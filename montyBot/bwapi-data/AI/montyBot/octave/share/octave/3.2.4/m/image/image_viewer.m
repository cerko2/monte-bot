## @deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{fcn}, @var{default_zoom}] =} image_viewer (@var{fcn}, @var{default_zoom})
## Change the program or function used for viewing images and return the
## previous values.
##
## When the @code{image} or @code{imshow} function is called it will
## launch an external program to display the image.  The default behavior
## is to use gnuplot if the installed version supports image viewing,
## and otherwise try the programs @code{display}, @code{xv}, and
## @code{xloadimage}.  Using this function it is possible to change that
## behavior.
##
## When called with one input argument images will be displayed by saving
## the image to a file and the system command @var{command} will be called
## to view the image.  The @var{command} must be a string containing
## @code{%s} and possibly @code{%f}.  The @code{%s} will be replaced by
## the filename of the image, and the @code{%f} will (if present) be
## replaced by the zoom factor given to the @code{image} function.
## For example,
## @example
## image_viewer ("eog %s");
## @end example
## changes the image viewer to the @code{eog} program.
##
## With two input arguments, images will be displayed by calling
## the function @var{function_handle}.  For example,
## @example
## image_viewer (data, @@my_image_viewer);
## @end example
## sets the image viewer function to @code{my_image_viewer}.  The image
## viewer function is called with
## @example
## my_image_viewer (@var{x}, @var{y}, @var{im}, @var{zoom}, @var{data})
## @end example
## where @var{x} and @var{y} are the axis of the image, @var{im} is the image
## variable, and @var{data} is extra user-supplied data to be passed to
## the viewer function.
##
## With three input arguments it is possible to change the zooming.
## Some programs (like @code{xloadimage}) require the zoom factor to be
## between 0 and 100, and not 0 and 1 like Octave assumes.  This is
## solved by setting the third argument to 100.
