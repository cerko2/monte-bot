## Return an @var{r} by @var{c} matrix of random samples from the
## lognormal distribution with parameters @var{a} and @var{v}.  Both
## @var{a} and @var{v} must be scalar or of size @var{r} by @var{c}.
## Or if @var{sz} is a vector, create a matrix of size @var{sz}.
##
## If @var{r} and @var{c} are omitted, the size of the result matrix is
## the common size of @var{a} and @var{v}.
