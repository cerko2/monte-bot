 -- Loadable Function: P = amd (S)
 -- Loadable Function: P = amd (S, OPTS)
     Returns the approximate minimum degree permutation of a matrix.  This permutation such that the Cholesky factorization of `S (P, P)' tends to be sparser than the Cholesky factorization of S itself.  `amd' is typically faster than `symamd' but serves a similar purpose.

     The optional parameter OPTS is a structure that controls the behavior of `amd'.  The fields of these structure are

    opts.dense
          Determines what `amd' considers to be a dense row or column of the input matrix.  Rows or columns with more than `max(16, (dense * sqrt (N)' entries, where N is the order of the matrix S, are ignored by `amd' during the calculation of the permutation The value of dense must be a positive scalar and its default value is 10.0

    opts.aggressive
          If this value is a non zero scalar, then `amd' performs aggressive absorption.  The default is not to perform aggressive absorption.

     The author of the code itself is Timothy A. Davis (davis@cise.ufl.edu), University of Florida (see `http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/amd').  See also: symamd, colamd.

 -- Loadable Function: AA = balance (A, OPT)
 -- Loadable Function: [DD, AA] = balance (A, OPT)
 -- Loadable Function: [D, P, AA] = balance (A, OPT)
 -- Loadable Function: [CC, DD, AA, BB] = balance (A, B, OPT)
     Compute `aa = dd \ a * dd' in which `aa' is a matrix whose row and column norms are roughly equal in magnitude, and `dd' = `p * d', in which `p' is a permutation matrix and `d' is a diagonal matrix of powers of two.  This allows the equilibration to be computed without roundoff.  Results of eigenvalue calculation are typically improved by balancing first.

     If two output values are requested, `balance' returns the diagonal `d' and the permutation `p' separately as vectors.  In this case, `dd = eye(n)(:,p) * diag (d)', where `n' is the matrix size.

     If four output values are requested, compute `aa = cc*a*dd' and `bb = cc*b*dd)', in which `aa' and `bb' have non-zero elements of approximately the same magnitude and `cc' and `dd' are permuted diagonal matrices as in `dd' for the algebraic eigenvalue problem.

     The eigenvalue balancing option `opt' may be one of:

    `"noperm"', `"S"'
          Scale only; do not permute.

    `"noscal"', `"P"'
          Permute only; do not scale.

     Algebraic eigenvalue balancing uses standard LAPACK routines.

     Generalized eigenvalue problem balancing uses Ward's algorithm (SIAM Journal on Scientific and Statistical Computing, 1981).

    `besselh'
          Compute Hankel functions of the first (K = 1) or second (K = 2) kind.  If the argument OPT is supplied, the result is multiplied by `exp (-I*X)' for K = 1 or `exp (I*X)' for K = 2.

     If ALPHA is a scalar, the result is the same size as X.  If X is a scalar, the result is the same size as ALPHA.  If ALPHA is a row vector and X is a column vector, the result is a matrix with `length (X)' rows and `length (ALPHA)' columns.  Otherwise, ALPHA and X must conform and the result will be the same size.

     The value of ALPHA must be real.  The value of X may be complex.

       3. Loss of significance by argument reduction results in less than half of machine accuracy.

       4. Complete loss of significance by argument reduction, return `NaN'.

       5. Error--no computation, algorithm termination condition not met, return `NaN'.

 -- Loadable Function: [P, STATS] = ccolamd (...)
     Constrained column approximate minimum degree permutation.  `P = ccolamd (S)' returns the column approximate minimum degree permutation vector for the sparse matrix S.  For a non-symmetric matrix S, `S (:, P)' tends to have sparser LU factors than S.  `chol (S (:, P)' * S (:, P))' also tends to be sparser than `chol (S' * S)'.  `P = ccolamd (S, 1)' optimizes the ordering for `lu (S (:, P))'.  The ordering is followed by a column elimination tree post-ordering.

     KNOBS is an optional one- to five-element input vector, with a default value of `[0 10 10 1 0]' if not present or empty.  Entries not present are set to their defaults.

    `KNOBS(1)'
          if nonzero, the ordering is optimized for `lu (S (:, p))'.  It will be a poor ordering for `chol (S (:, P)' * S (:, P))'.  This is the most important knob for ccolamd.

    `KNOB(2)'
          if S is m-by-n, rows with more than `max (16, KNOBS (2) * sqrt (n))' entries are ignored.

    `KNOB(3)'
          columns with more than `max (16, KNOBS (3) * sqrt (min (M, N)))' entries are ignored and ordered last in the output permutation (subject to the cmember constraints).

    `KNOB(4)'
          if nonzero, aggressive absorption is performed.

    `KNOB(5)'
          if nonzero, statistics and knobs are printed.


     CMEMBER is an optional vector of length n.  It defines the constraints on the column ordering.  If `CMEMBER (j) = C', then column J is in constraint set C (C must be in the range 1 to N).  In the output permutation P, all columns in set 1 appear first, followed by all columns in set 2, and so on.  `CMEMBER = ones(1,n)' if not present or empty.  `ccolamd (S, [], 1 : N)' returns `1 : N'

     `P = ccolamd (S)' is about the same as `P = colamd (S)'.  KNOBS and its default values differ.  `colamd' always does aggressive absorption, and it finds an ordering suitable for both `lu (S (:, P))' and `chol (S (:, P)' * S (:, P))'; it cannot optimize its ordering for `lu (S (:, P))' to the extent that `ccolamd (S, 1)' can.

     STATS is an optional 20-element output vector that provides data about the ordering and the validity of the input matrix S.  Ordering statistics are in `STATS (1 : 3)'.  `STATS (1)' and `STATS (2)' are the number of dense or empty rows and columns ignored by CCOLAMD and `STATS (3)' is the number of garbage collections performed on the internal data structure used by CCOLAMD (roughly of size `2.2 * nnz (S) + 4 * M + 7 * N' integers).

     `STATS (4 : 7)' provide information if CCOLAMD was able to continue.  The matrix is OK if `STATS (4)' is zero, or 1 if invalid.  `STATS (5)' is the rightmost column index that is unsorted or contains duplicate entries, or zero if no such column exists.  `STATS (6)' is the last seen duplicate or out-of-order row index in the column index given by `STATS (5)', or zero if no such row index exists.  `STATS (7)' is the number of duplicate or out-of-order row indices.  `STATS (8 : 20)' is always zero in the current version of CCOLAMD (reserved for future use).

     For a symmetric positive definite matrix S, returns the permutation vector P such that `S(P,P)' tends to have a sparser Cholesky factor than S.  Sometimes `csymamd' works well for symmetric indefinite matrices too.  The matrix S is assumed to be symmetric; only the strictly lower triangular part is referenced.  S must be square.

 -- Loadable Function:  cellfun (..., 'UniformOutput', VAL)
     Evaluate the function named NAME on the elements of the cell array C.  Elements in C are passed on to the named function individually.  The function NAME can be one of the functions

    `isempty'
          Return 1 for empty elements.

    `islogical'
          Return 1 for logical elements.

    `isreal'
          Return 1 for real elements.

    `length'
          Return a vector of the lengths of cell elements.

    `ndims'
          Return the number of dimensions of each element.

    `prodofsize'
          Return the product of dimensions of each element.

    `size'
          Return the size along the K-th dimension.

    `isclass'
          Return 1 for elements of CLASS.

     Additionally, `cellfun' accepts an arbitrary function FUNC in the form of an inline function, function handle, or the name of a function (in a character string).  In the case of a character string argument, the function must accept a single argument named X, and it must return a string value.  The function can take one or more arguments, with the inputs args given by C, D, etc.  Equally the function can return one or more output arguments.  For example

          cellfun (@atan2, {1, 0}, {0, 1})
          =>ans = [1.57080   0.00000]

     Note that the default output argument is an array of the same size as the input arguments.

     If the parameter 'UniformOutput' is set to true (the default), then the function must return a single element which will be concatenated into the return value.  If 'UniformOutput' is false, the outputs are concatenated in a cell array.  For example

          cellfun ("tolower(x)", {"Foo", "Bar", "FooBar"},
                   "UniformOutput",false)
          => ans = {"foo", "bar", "foobar"}

     Given the parameter 'ErrorHandler', then ERRFUNC defines a function to call in case FUNC generates an error.  The form of the function is

          function [...] = errfunc (S, ...)

     where there is an additional input argument to ERRFUNC relative to FUNC, given by S.  This is a structure with the elements 'identifier', 'message' and 'index', giving respectively the error identifier, the error message, and the index into the input arguments of the element that caused the error.  For example

          function y = foo (s, x), y = NaN; endfunction
          cellfun (@factorial, {-1,2},'ErrorHandler',@foo)
          => ans = [NaN 2]

     Convert the matrix A to a cell array.  If A is 2-D, then it is required that `sum (M) == size (A, 1)' and `sum (N) == size (A, 2)'.  Similarly, if A is a multi-dimensional and the number of dimensional arguments is equal to the dimensions of A, then it is required that `sum (DI) == size (A, i)'.

 -- Loadable Function: SL = cellslices (X, LB, UB)
     Given a vector X, this function produces a cell array of slices from the vector determined by the index vectors LB, UB, for lower and upper bounds, respectively.  In other words, it is equivalent to the following code:

          n = length (lb);
          sl = cell (1, n);
          for i = 1:length (lb)
            sl{i} = x(lb(i):ub(i));
          endfor

 -- Loadable Function: [R, P, Q] = chol (S)
 -- Loadable Function: [R, P, Q] = chol (S, 'vector')
 -- Loadable Function: [L, ...] = chol (..., 'lower')
     Compute the Cholesky factor, R, of the symmetric positive definite matrix A, where

          R' * R = A.

     Called with one output argument `chol' fails if A or S is not positive definite.  With two or more output arguments P flags whether the matrix was positive definite and `chol' does not fail.  A zero value indicated that the matrix was positive definite and the R gives the factorization, and P will have a positive value otherwise.

     If called with 3 outputs then a sparsity preserving row/column permutation is applied to A prior to the factorization.  That is R is the factorization of `A(Q,Q)' such that

          R' * R = Q' * A * Q.

     The sparsity preserving permutation is generally returned as a matrix.  However, given the flag 'vector', Q will be returned as a vector such that

          R' * R = a (Q, Q).

     Called with either a sparse or full matrix and using the 'lower' flag, `chol' returns the lower triangular factorization such that

          L * L' = A.

     In general the lower triangular factorization is significantly faster for sparse matrices.  See also: cholinv, chol2inv.

 -- Loadable Function: [P, STATS] = colamd (S, KNOBS)
     Column approximate minimum degree permutation.  `P = colamd (S)' returns the column approximate minimum degree permutation vector for the sparse matrix S.  For a non-symmetric matrix S, `S (:,P)' tends to have sparser LU factors than S.  The Cholesky factorization of `S (:,P)' * S (:,P)' also tends to be sparser than that of `S' * S'.

     KNOBS is an optional one- to three-element input vector.  If S is m-by-n, then rows with more than `max(16,KNOBS(1)*sqrt(n))' entries are ignored.  Columns with more than `max(16,knobs(2)*sqrt(min(m,n)))' entries are removed prior to ordering, and ordered last in the output permutation P.  Only completely dense rows or columns are removed if `KNOBS (1)' and `KNOBS (2)' are < 0, respectively.  If `KNOBS (3)' is nonzero, STATS and KNOBS are printed.  The default is `KNOBS = [10 10 0]'.  Note that KNOBS differs from earlier versions of colamd

     STATS is an optional 20-element output vector that provides data about the ordering and the validity of the input matrix S.  Ordering statistics are in `STATS (1:3)'.  `STATS (1)' and `STATS (2)' are the number of dense or empty rows and columns ignored by COLAMD and `STATS (3)' is the number of garbage collections performed on the internal data structure used by COLAMD (roughly of size `2.2 * nnz(S) + 4 * M + 7 * N' integers).

     Octave built-in functions are intended to generate valid sparse matrices, with no duplicate entries, with ascending row indices of the nonzeros in each column, with a non-negative number of entries in each column (!)  and so on.  If a matrix is invalid, then COLAMD may or may not be able to continue.  If there are duplicate entries (a row index appears two or more times in the same column) or if the row indices in a column are out of order, then COLAMD can correct these errors by ignoring the duplicate entries and sorting each column of its internal copy of the matrix S (the input matrix S is not repaired, however).  If a matrix is invalid in other ways then COLAMD cannot continue, an error message is printed, and no output arguments (P or STATS) are returned.  COLAMD is thus a simple way to check a sparse matrix to see if it's valid.

     `STATS (4:7)' provide information if COLAMD was able to continue.  The matrix is OK if `STATS (4)' is zero, or 1 if invalid.  `STATS (5)' is the rightmost column index that is unsorted or contains duplicate entries, or zero if no such column exists.  `STATS (6)' is the last seen duplicate or out-of-order row index in the column index given by `STATS (5)', or zero if no such row index exists.  `STATS (7)' is the number of duplicate or out-of-order row indices.  `STATS (8:20)' is always zero in the current version of COLAMD (reserved for future use).

     The ordering is followed by a column elimination tree post-ordering.

     For a symmetric positive definite matrix S, returns the permutation vector p such that `S (P, P)' tends to have a sparser Cholesky factor than S.  Sometimes SYMAMD works well for symmetric indefinite matrices too.  The matrix S is assumed to be symmetric; only the strictly lower triangular part is referenced.  S must be square.

     KNOBS is an optional one- to two-element input vector.  If S is n-by-n, then rows and columns with more than `max(16,KNOBS(1)*sqrt(n))' entries are removed prior to ordering, and ordered last in the output permutation P.  No rows/columns are removed if `KNOBS(1) < 0'.  If `KNOBS (2)' is nonzero, `stats' and KNOBS are printed.  The default is `KNOBS = [10 0]'.  Note that KNOBS differs from earlier versions of symamd.

     STATS is an optional 20-element output vector that provides data about the ordering and the validity of the input matrix S.

     Options include

          Denoting the differential variables in the state vector by `Y_d' and the algebraic variables by `Y_a', `ddaspk' can solve one of two initialization problems:

            1. Given Y_d, calculate Y_a and Y'_d

            2. Given Y', calculate Y.

          In either case, initial values for the given components are input, and initial guesses for the unknown components must also be provided as input.  Set this option to 1 to solve the first problem, or 2 to solve the second (the default is 0, so you must provide a set of initial conditions that are consistent).

          If this option is set to a nonzero value, you must also set the `"algebraic variables"' option to declare which variables in the problem are algebraic.

    `"use initial condition heuristics"'
          Set to a nonzero value to use the initial condition heuristics options described below.

               Maximum number of Newton iterations (default is 5).

         `MXNJ'
               Maximum number of Jacobian evaluations (default is 6).

         `MXNH'
               Maximum number of values of the artificial stepsize parameter to be tried if the `"compute consistent initial condition"' option has been set to 1 (default is 5).

               Note that the maximum total number of Newton iterations allowed is `MXNIT*MXNJ*MXNH' if the `"compute consistent initial condition"' option has been set to 1 and `MXNIT*MXNJ' if it is set to 2.

         `LSOFF'
               Set to a nonzero value to disable the linesearch algorithm (default is 0).

         `STPTOL'
               Minimum scaled step in linesearch algorithm (default is eps^(2/3)).

         `EPINIT'
               Swing factor in the Newton iteration convergence test.  The test is applied to the residual vector, premultiplied by the approximate Jacobian.  For convergence, the weighted RMS norm of this vector (scaled by the error weights) must be less than `EPINIT*EPCON', where `EPCON' = 0.33 is the analogous test constant used in the time steps.  The default is `EPINIT' = 0.01.

    `"print initial condition info"'
          Set this option to a nonzero value to display detailed information about the initial condition calculation (default is 0).

    `"exclude algebraic variables from error test"'
          Set to a nonzero value to exclude algebraic variables from the error test.  You must also set the `"algebraic variables"' option to declare which variables in the problem are algebraic (default is 0).

    `"algebraic variables"'
          A vector of the same length as the state vector.  A nonzero element indicates that the corresponding element of the state vector is an algebraic variable (i.e., its derivative does not appear explicitly in the equation set.

          This option is required by the `compute consistent initial condition"' and `"exclude algebraic variables from error test"' options.

    `"enforce inequality constraints"'
          Set to one of the following values to enforce the inequality constraints specified by the `"inequality constraint types"' option (default is 0).

            1. To have constraint checking only in the initial condition calculation.

            2. To enforce constraint checking during the integration.

            3. To enforce both options 1 and 2.

    `"inequality constraint types"'
          A vector of the same length as the state specifying the type of inequality constraint.  Each element of the vector corresponds to an element of the state and should be assigned one of the following codes

         -2
               Less than zero.

         -1
               Less than or equal to zero.

         0
               Not constrained.

         1
               Greater than or equal to zero.

         2
               Greater than zero.

          This option only has an effect if the `"enforce inequality constraints"' option is nonzero.

    `"initial step size"'
          Differential-algebraic problems may occasionally suffer from severe scaling difficulties on the first step.  If you know a great deal about the scaling of your problem, you can help to alleviate this problem by specifying an initial stepsize (default is computed automatically).

    `"maximum order"'
          Restrict the maximum order of the solution method.  This option must be between 1 and 5, inclusive (default is 5).

    `"maximum step size"'
          Setting the maximum stepsize will avoid passing over very large regions (default is not specified).

     with

          x(t_0) = x_0, xdot(t_0) = xdot_0

     The solution is returned in the matrices X and XDOT, with each row in the result matrices corresponding to one of the elements in the vector T.  The first element of T should be t_0 and correspond to the initial state of the system X_0 and its derivative XDOT_0, so that the first row of the output X is X_0 and the first row of the output XDOT is XDOT_0.

     The first argument, FCN, is a string, inline, or function handle that names the function f to call to compute the vector of residuals for the set of equations.  It must have the form

          RES = f (X, XDOT, T)

     in which X, XDOT, and RES are vectors, and T is a scalar.

     If FCN is a two-element string array or a two-element cell array of strings, inline functions, or function handles, the first element names the function f described above, and the second element names a function to compute the modified Jacobian

     The modified Jacobian function must have the form


          JAC = j (X, XDOT, T, C)

     The second and third arguments to `daspk' specify the initial condition of the states and their derivatives, and the fourth argument specifies a vector of output times at which the solution is desired, including the time corresponding to the initial condition.

     The set of initial states and derivatives are not strictly required to be consistent.  If they are not consistent, you must use the `daspk_options' function to provide additional information so that `daspk' can compute a consistent starting point.

     The fifth argument is optional, and may be used to specify a set of times that the DAE solver should not integrate past.  It is useful for avoiding difficulties with singularities and points where there is a discontinuity in the derivative.

     After a successful computation, the value of ISTATE will be greater than zero (consistent with the Fortran version of DASPK).

     If the computation is not successful, the value of ISTATE will be less than zero and MSG will contain additional information.

If no arguments are supplied, the names of all the available options and their current values are displayed.

     Options include

    `"absolute tolerance"'
          Absolute tolerance.  May be either vector or scalar.  If a vector, it must match the dimension of the state vector, and the relative tolerance must also be a vector of the same length.

 -- Loadable Function: [X, XDOT, T_OUT, ISTAT, MSG] = dasrt (FCN [, G], X_0, XDOT_0, T [, T_CRIT])
     Solve the set of differential-algebraic equations

          0 = f (x, xdot, t)

     with

          x(t_0) = x_0, xdot(t_0) = xdot_0

     with functional stopping criteria (root solving).

     The solution is returned in the matrices X and XDOT, with each row in the result matrices corresponding to one of the elements in the vector T_OUT.  The first element of T should be t_0 and correspond to the initial state of the system X_0 and its derivative XDOT_0, so that the first row of the output X is X_0 and the first row of the output XDOT is XDOT_0.

     The vector T provides an upper limit on the length of the integration.  If the stopping condition is met, the vector T_OUT will be shorter than T, and the final element of T_OUT will be the point at which the stopping condition was met, and may not correspond to any element of the vector T.

     The first argument, FCN, is a string, inline, or function handle that names the function f to call to compute the vector of residuals for the set of equations.  It must have the form

          RES = f (X, XDOT, T)

     in which X, XDOT, and RES are vectors, and T is a scalar.

     If FCN is a two-element string array or a two-element cell array of strings, inline functions, or function handles, the first element names the function f described above, and the second element names a function to compute the modified Jacobian

                df       df
          jac = -- + c ------
                dx     d xdot

     The modified Jacobian function must have the form


          JAC = j (X, XDOT, T, C)

     The optional second argument names a function that defines the constraint functions whose roots are desired during the integration.  This function must have the form

          G_OUT = g (X, T)

     and return a vector of the constraint function values.  If the value of any of the constraint functions changes sign, DASRT will attempt to stop the integration at the point of the sign change.

     If the name of the constraint function is omitted, `dasrt' solves the same problem as `daspk' or `dassl'.

     Note that because of numerical errors in the constraint functions due to roundoff and integration error, DASRT may return false roots, or return the same root at two or more nearly equal values of T.  If such false roots are suspected, the user should consider smaller error tolerances or higher precision in the evaluation of the constraint functions.

     If a root of some constraint function defines the end of the problem, the input to DASRT should nevertheless allow integration to a point slightly past that root, so that DASRT can locate the root by interpolation.

     The third and fourth arguments to `dasrt' specify the initial condition of the states and their derivatives, and the fourth argument specifies a vector of output times at which the solution is desired, including the time corresponding to the initial condition.

     The set of initial states and derivatives are not strictly required to be consistent.  In practice, however, DASSL is not very good at determining a consistent set for you, so it is best if you ensure that the initial values result in the function evaluating to zero.

     The sixth argument is optional, and may be used to specify a set of times that the DAE solver should not integrate past.  It is useful for avoiding difficulties with singularities and points where there is a discontinuity in the derivative.

     After a successful computation, the value of ISTATE will be greater than zero (consistent with the Fortran version of DASSL).

     If the computation is not successful, the value of ISTATE will be less than zero and MSG will contain additional information.

 -- Loadable Function:  dassl_options (OPT, VAL)
     When called with two arguments, this function allows you set options parameters for the function `dassl'.  Given one argument, `dassl_options' returns the value of the corresponding option.  If no arguments are supplied, the names of all the available options and their current values are displayed.

     Options include

    `"compute consistent initial condition"'
          If nonzero, `dassl' will attempt to compute a consistent set of initial conditions.  This is generally not reliable, so it is best to provide a consistent set and leave this option set to zero.

    `"enforce nonnegativity constraints"'
          If you know that the solutions to your equations will always be nonnegative, it may help to set this parameter to a nonzero value.  However, it is probably best to try leaving this option set to zero first, and only setting it to a nonzero value if that doesn't work very well.

    `"initial step size"'

     If the optional argument 'native' is given, then the sum is performed in the same type as the original argument, rather than in the default double type.  For example

          sum ([true, true])
            => 2

     When called with no arguments, return a scalar with the value `realmin("double")'.  When called with a single argument, return a square matrix with the dimension specified.  When called with more than one scalar argument the first two arguments are taken as the number of rows and columns and any further arguments specify additional matrix dimensions.  The optional argument CLASS specifies the return type and may be either "double" or "single".  See also: realmax, intmin.

 -- Built-in Function:  eye (..., CLASS)
     Return an identity matrix.  If invoked with a single scalar argument, `eye' returns a square matrix with the dimension specified.  If you supply two scalar arguments, `eye' takes them to be the number of rows and columns.  If given a vector with two elements, `eye' uses the values of the elements as the number of rows and columns, respectively.  For example,

          eye (3)
               =>  1  0  0
                   0  1  0
                   0  0  1

     The following expressions all produce the same result:

          eye (2)
          ==
          eye (2, 2)
          ==
          eye (size ([1, 2; 3, 4])

     The optional argument CLASS, allows `eye' to return an array of the specified type, like

          val = zeros (n,m, "uint8")

     Calling `eye' with no arguments is equivalent to calling it with an argument of 1.  This odd definition is for compatibility with MATLAB.

 -- Built-in Function:  linspace (BASE, LIMIT, N)
     Return a row vector with N linearly spaced elements between BASE and LIMIT.  If the number of elements is greater than one, then the BASE and LIMIT are always included in the range.  If BASE is greater than LIMIT, the elements are stored in decreasing order.  If the number of points is not specified, a value of 100 is used.

     The `linspace' function always returns a row vector.

     For compatibility with MATLAB, return the second argument if fewer than two values are requested.

 -- Built-in Function:  resize (X, M)
 -- Built-in Function:  resize (X, M, N)
 -- Built-in Function:  resize (X, M, N, ...)
     Resize X cutting off elements as necessary.

     In the result, element with certain indices is equal to the corresponding element of X if the indices are within the bounds of X; otherwise, the element is set to zero.

     In other words, the statement

            y = resize (x, dv);

     is equivalent to the following code:

            y = zeros (dv, class (x));
            sz = min (dv, size (x));
            for i = 1:length (sz), idx{i} = 1:sz(i); endfor
            y(idx{:}) = x(idx{:});

     but is performed more efficiently.

     If only M is supplied and it is a scalar, the dimension of the result is M-by-M.  If M is a vector, then the dimensions of the result are given by the elements of M.  If both M and N are scalars, then the dimensions of the result are M-by-N.

     An object can be resized to more dimensions than it has; in such case the missing dimensions are assumed to be 1.  Resizing an object to fewer dimensions is not possible.  See also: reshape, postpad.

 -- Built-in Function:  reshape (A, M, N, ...)
 -- Built-in Function:  reshape (A, SIZE)
     Return a matrix with the given dimensions whose elements are taken from the matrix A.  The elements of the matrix are accessed in column-major order (like Fortran arrays are stored).

          reshape ([1, 2, 3, 4], 2, 2)
               =>  1  3
                   2  4

     Note that the total number of elements in the original matrix must match the total number of elements in the new matrix.

     A single dimension of the return matrix can be unknown and is flagged by an empty argument.

     If A is a matrix (or sparse matrix):

    P = `1'
          1-norm, the largest column sum of the absolute values of A.

    P = `2'
          Largest singular value of A.

    P = `Inf' or `"inf"'
          Infinity norm, the largest row sum of the absolute values of A.

    other P, `P > 1'
          maximum `norm (A*x, p)' such that `norm (x, p) == 1'

     If A is a vector or a scalar:

    P = `Inf' or `"inf"'
          `max (abs (A))'.

    P = `-Inf'
          `min (abs (A))'.

    P = `"fro"'
          Frobenius norm of A, `sqrt (sumsq (abs (a)))'.

 -- Built-in Function:  tic ()
 -- Built-in Function:  toc ()
     Set or check a wall-clock timer.  Calling `tic' without an output argument sets the timer.  Subsequent calls to `toc' return the number of seconds since the timer was set.  For example,

          tic ();
          # many computations later...
          elapsed_time = toc ();

     will set the variable `elapsed_time' to the number of seconds since the most recent call to the function `tic'.

     If called with one output argument then this function returns a scalar of type `uint64' and the wall-clock timer is not started.

          t = tic; sleep (5); (double (tic ()) - double (t)) * 1e-6
               => 5

     Nested timing with `tic' and `toc' is not supported.  Therefore `toc' will always return the elapsed time from the most recent call to `tic'.

     If you are more interested in the CPU time that your process used, you should use the `cputime' function instead.  The `tic' and `toc' functions report the actual wall clock time that elapsed between the calls.  This may include time spent processing other jobs or doing nothing at all.  For example,

          tic (); sleep (5); toc ()
               => 5
          t = cputime (); sleep (5); cputime () - t
               => 0

     (This example also illustrates that the CPU timer may have a fairly coarse resolution.)

     Return the CPU time used by your Octave session.  The first output is the total time spent executing your process and is equal to the sum of second and third outputs, which are the number of CPU seconds spent executing in user mode and the number of CPU seconds spent executing in system mode, respectively.  If your system does not have a way to report CPU time usage, `cputime' returns 0 for each of its output values.  Note that because Octave used some CPU time to start, it is reasonable to check to see if `cputime' works by checking to see if the total CPU time used is nonzero.

     Return a copy of X with the elements arranged in increasing order.  For matrices, `sort' orders the elements in each column.

     For example,

          sort ([1, 2; 2, 3; 3, 1])
               =>  1  1
                   2  2
                   3  3

     The `sort' function may also be used to produce a matrix containing the original row indices of the elements in the sorted matrix.  For example,

          [s, i] = sort ([1, 2; 2, 3; 3, 1])
               => s = 1  1
                      2  2
                      3  3
               => i = 1  3
                      2  1
                      3  2

     If the optional argument DIM is given, then the matrix is sorted along the dimension defined by DIM.  The optional argument `mode' defines the order in which the values will be sorted.  Valid values of `mode' are `ascend' or `descend'.

     For equal elements, the indices are such that the equal elements are listed in the order that appeared in the original list.

     The `sort' function may also be used to sort strings and cell arrays of strings, in which case the dictionary order of the strings is used.

     The algorithm used in `sort' is optimized for the sorting of partially ordered lists.

As such the numerical rank of the matrix S is bounded by `sprank (S) >= rank (S)'.  Ignoring floating point errors `sprank (S) == rank (S)'.  See also: dmperm.

     The eigenvalues (and eigenvectors) of a matrix are computed in a several step process which begins with a Hessenberg decomposition, followed by a Schur decomposition, from which the eigenvalues are apparent.  The eigenvectors, when desired, are computed by further manipulations of the Schur decomposition.

     The eigenvalues returned by `eig' are not ordered.  See also: eigs.

     Calculate a limited number of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A, based on a selection criteria.  The number eigenvalues and eigenvectors to calculate is given by K whose default value is 6.

     By default `eigs' solve the equation `A * v = lambda * v' , where `lambda' is a scalar representing one of the eigenvalues, and `v' is the corresponding eigenvector.  If given the positive definite matrix B then `eigs' solves the general eigenvalue equation `A * v = lambda * B * v' .

     The argument SIGMA determines which eigenvalues are returned.  SIGMA can be either a scalar or a string.  When SIGMA is a scalar, the K eigenvalues closest to SIGMA are returned.  If SIGMA is a string, it must have one of the values

    'lm'
          Largest magnitude (default).

    'sm'
          Smallest magnitude.

    'la'
          Largest Algebraic (valid only for real symmetric problems).

    'sa'
          Smallest Algebraic (valid only for real symmetric problems).

    'be'
          Both ends, with one more from the high-end if K is odd (valid only for real symmetric problems).

    'lr'
          Largest real part (valid only for complex or unsymmetric problems).

    'sr'
          Smallest real part (valid only for complex or unsymmetric problems).

    'li'
          Largest imaginary part (valid only for complex or unsymmetric problems).

    'si'
          Smallest imaginary part (valid only for complex or unsymmetric problems).

     If OPTS is given, it is a structure defining some of the options that `eigs' should use.  The fields of the structure OPTS are

    `issym'
          If AF is given, then flags whether the function AF defines a symmetric problem.  It is ignored if A is given.  The default is false.

    `isreal'
          If AF is given, then flags whether the function AF defines a real problem.  It is ignored if A is given.  The default is true.

    `tol'
          Defines the required convergence tolerance, given as `tol * norm (A)'.  The default is `eps'.

    `maxit'
          The maximum number of iterations.  The default is 300.

    `p'
          The number of Lanzcos basis vectors to use.  More vectors will result in faster convergence, but a larger amount of memory.  The optimal value of 'p' is problem dependent and should be in the range K to N.  The default value is `2 * K'.

    `v0'
          The starting vector for the computation.  The default is to have ARPACK randomly generate a starting vector.

    `disp'
          The level of diagnostic printout.  If `disp' is 0 then there is no printout.  The default value is 1.

    `cholB'
          Flag if `chol (B)' is passed rather than B.  The default is false.

    `permB'
          The permutation vector of the Cholesky factorization of B if `cholB' is true.  That is `chol ( B (permB, permB))'.  The default is `1:N'.


     It is also possible to represent A by a function denoted AF.  AF must be followed by a scalar argument N defining the length of the vector argument accepted by AF.  AF can be passed either as an inline function, function handle or as a string.  In the case where AF is passed as a string, the name of the string defines the function to use.

     AF is a function of the form `function y = af (x), y = ...; endfunction', where the required return value of AF is determined by the value of SIGMA, and are

    `A * x'
          If SIGMA is not given or is a string other than 'sm'.

    `A \ x'
          If SIGMA is 'sm'.

    `(A - sigma * I) \ x'
          for standard eigenvalue problem, where `I' is the identity matrix of the same size as `A'.  If SIGMA is zero, this reduces the `A \ x'.

    `(A - sigma * B) \ x'
          for the general eigenvalue problem.

     The return arguments of `eigs' depends on the number of return arguments.  With a single return argument, a vector D of length K is returned, represent the K eigenvalues that have been found.  With two return arguments, V is a N-by-K matrix whose columns are the K eigenvectors corresponding to the returned eigenvalues.  The eigenvalues themselves are then returned in D in the form of a N-by-K matrix, where the elements on the diagonal are the eigenvalues.

     Given a third return argument FLAG, `eigs' also returns the status of the convergence.  If FLAG is 0, then all eigenvalues have converged, otherwise not.

     This function is based on the ARPACK package, written by R Lehoucq, K Maschhoff, D Sorensen and C Yang.  For more information see `http://www.caam.rice.edu/software/ARPACK/'.

 -- Built-in Function:  rethrow (ERR)
     Reissues a previous error as defined by ERR.  ERR is a structure that must contain at least the 'message' and 'identifier' fields.  ERR can also contain a field 'stack' that gives information on the assumed location of the error.  Typically ERR is returned from `lasterror'.  See also: lasterror, lasterr, error.

 -- Built-in Function:  error (TEMPLATE, ...)
 -- Built-in Function:  error (ID, TEMPLATE, ...)
     Format the optional arguments under the control of the template string TEMPLATE using the same rules as the `printf' family of functions (*note Formatted Output::) and print the resulting message on the `stderr' stream.  The message is prefixed by the character string `error: '.

     Calling `error' also sets Octave's internal error state such that control will return to the top level without evaluating any more commands.  This is useful for aborting from functions or scripts.

     If the error message does not end with a new line character, Octave will print a traceback of all the function calls leading to the error.  For example, given the following function definitions:

          function f () g (); end
          function g () h (); end
          function h () nargin == 1 || error ("nargin != 1"); end

     calling the function `f' will result in a list of messages that can help you to quickly locate the exact location of the error:

          f ()
          error: nargin != 1
          error: called from:
          error:   error at line -1, column -1
          error:   h at line 1, column 27
          error:   g at line 1, column 15
          error:   f at line 1, column 15

     If the error message ends in a new line character, Octave will print the message but will not display any traceback messages as it returns control to the top level.  For example, modifying the error message in the previous example to end in a new line causes Octave to only print a single message:

          function h () nargin == 1 || error ("nargin != 1\n"); end
          f ()
          error: nargin != 1

 -- Built-in Function:  warning (TEMPLATE, ...)
 -- Built-in Function:  warning (ID, TEMPLATE, ...)
     Format the optional arguments under the control of the template string TEMPLATE using the same rules as the `printf' family of functions (*note Formatted Output::) and print the resulting message on the `stderr' stream.  The message is prefixed by the character string `warning: '.  You should use this function when you want to notify the user of an unusual condition, but only when it makes sense for your program to go on.

     The optional message identifier allows users to enable or disable warnings tagged by ID.  The special identifier `"all"' may be used to set the state of all warnings.

 -- Built-in Function:  warning ("on", ID)
 -- Built-in Function:  warning ("off", ID)
 -- Built-in Function:  warning ("error", ID)
 -- Built-in Function:  warning ("query", ID)
     Set or query the state of a particular warning using the identifier ID.  If the identifier is omitted, a value of `"all"' is assumed.  If you set the state of a warning to `"error"', the warning named by ID is handled as if it were an error instead.  See also: warning_ids.

 -- Built-in Function: ERR = lasterror (ERR)
 -- Built-in Function:  lasterror ('reset')
     Returns or sets the last error message.  Called without any arguments returns a structure containing the last error message, as well as other information related to this error.  The elements of this structure are:

    'message'
          The text of the last error message

    'identifier'
          The message identifier of this error message

    'stack'
          A structure containing information on where the message occurred.  This might be an empty structure if this in the case where this information cannot be obtained.  The fields of this structure are:

         'file'
               The name of the file where the error occurred

         'name'
               The name of function in which the error occurred

         'line'
               The line number at which the error occurred

         'column'
               An optional field with the column number at which the error occurred

     The ERR structure may also be passed to `lasterror' to set the information about the last error.  The only constraint on ERR in that case is that it is a scalar structure.  Any fields of ERR that match the above are set to the value passed in ERR, while other fields are set to their default values.

     If `lasterror' is called with the argument 'reset', all values take their default values.

     Print the message MSG, prefixed by the string `usage: ', and set Octave's internal error state such that control will return to the top level without evaluating any more commands.  This is useful for aborting from functions.

     After `usage' is evaluated, Octave will print a traceback of all the function calls leading to the usage message.

     You should use this function for reporting problems errors that result from an improper call to a function, such as calling a function with an incorrect number of arguments, or with arguments of the wrong type.  For example, most functions distributed with Octave begin with code like this

          if (nargin != 2)
            usage ("foo (a, b)");
          endif

 -- Loadable Function: WISDOM = fftw ('dwisdom')
 -- Loadable Function: WISDOM = fftw ('dwisdom', WISDOM)
     Manage FFTW wisdom data.  Wisdom data can be used to significantly accelerate the calculation of the FFTs but implies an initial cost in its calculation.  When the FFTW libraries are initialized, they read a system wide wisdom file (typically in `/etc/fftw/wisdom'), allowing wisdom to be shared between applications other than Octave.  Alternatively, the `fftw' function can be used to import wisdom.  For example

          WISDOM = fftw ('dwisdom')

     will save the existing wisdom used by Octave to the string WISDOM.  This string can then be saved to a file and restored using the `save' and `load' commands respectively.  This existing wisdom can be reimported as follows

          fftw ('dwisdom', WISDOM)

     If WISDOM is an empty matrix, then the wisdom used is cleared.

     During the calculation of Fourier transforms further wisdom is generated.  The fashion in which this wisdom is generated is equally controlled by the `fftw' function.  There are five different manners in which the wisdom can be treated, these being

    'estimate'
          This specifies that no run-time measurement of the optimal means of calculating a particular is performed, and a simple heuristic is used to pick a (probably sub-optimal) plan.  The advantage of this method is that there is little or no overhead in the generation of the plan, which is appropriate for a Fourier transform that will be calculated once.

    'measure'
          In this case a range of algorithms to perform the transform is considered and the best is selected based on their execution time.

    'patient'
          This is like 'measure', but a wider range of algorithms is considered.

    'exhaustive'
          This is like 'measure', but all possible algorithms that may be used to treat the transform are considered.

    'hybrid'
          As run-time measurement of the algorithm can be expensive, this is a compromise where 'measure' is used for transforms up to the size of 8192 and beyond that the 'estimate' method is used.

     The default method is 'estimate', and the method currently being used can be probed with

          METHOD = fftw ('planner')

     and the method used can be set using

          fftw ('planner', METHOD)

     Note that calculated wisdom will be lost when restarting Octave.  However, the wisdom data can be reloaded if it is saved to a file as described above.  Saved wisdom files should not be used on different platforms since they will not be efficient and the point of calculating the wisdom is lost.  See also: fft, ifft, fft2, ifft2, fftn, ifftn.

 -- Built-in Function: [FID, MSG] = fopen (NAME, MODE, ARCH)
 -- Built-in Function: FID_LIST = fopen ("all")
 -- Built-in Function: [FILE, MODE, ARCH] = fopen (FID)
     The first form of the `fopen' function opens the named file with the specified mode (read-write, read-only, etc.) and architecture interpretation (IEEE big endian, IEEE little endian, etc.), and returns an integer value that may be used to refer to the file later.  If an error occurs, FID is set to -1 and MSG contains the corresponding system error message.  The MODE is a one or two character string that specifies whether the file is to be opened for reading, writing, or both.

     The second form of the `fopen' function returns a vector of file ids corresponding to all the currently open files, excluding the `stdin', `stdout', and `stderr' streams.

     The third form of the `fopen' function returns information about the open file given its file id.

     For example,

          myfile = fopen ("splat.dat", "r", "ieee-le");

     opens the file `splat.dat' for reading.  If necessary, binary numeric values will be read assuming they are stored in IEEE format with the least significant bit first, and then converted to the native representation.

     Opening a file that is already open simply opens it again and returns a separate file id.  It is not an error to open a file several times, though writing to the same file through several different file ids may produce unexpected results.

     The possible values `mode' may have are

    `r'
          Open a file for reading.

    `w'
          Open a file for writing.  The previous contents are discarded.

    `a'
          Open or create a file for writing at the end of the file.

    `r+'
          Open an existing file for reading and writing.

    `w+'
          Open a file for reading or writing.  The previous contents are discarded.

    `a+'
          Open or create a file for reading or writing at the end of the file.

     Append a "t" to the mode string to open the file in text mode or a "b" to open in binary mode.  On Windows and Macintosh systems, text mode reading and writing automatically converts linefeeds to the appropriate line end character for the system (carriage-return linefeed on Windows, carriage-return on Macintosh).  The default if no mode is specified is binary mode.

     Additionally, you may append a "z" to the mode string to open a gzipped file for reading or writing.  For this to be successful, you must also open the file in binary mode.

     The parameter ARCH is a string specifying the default data format for the file.  Valid values for ARCH are:

          `native' The format of the current machine (this is the default).

          `ieee-be' IEEE big endian format.

          `ieee-le' IEEE little endian format.

          `vaxd' VAX D floating format.

          `vaxg' VAX G floating format.

          `cray' Cray floating format.

     however, conversions are currently only supported for `native' `ieee-be', and `ieee-le' formats.  See also: fclose, fgets, fputs, fread, fseek, ferror, fprintf, fscanf, ftell, fwrite.

    `Inf'
          Read as much as possible, returning a column vector.

    `NR'
          Read up to NR elements, returning a column vector.

    `[NR, Inf]'
          Read as much as possible, returning a matrix with NR rows.  If the number of elements read is not an exact multiple of NR, the last column is padded with zeros.

    `[NR, NC]'
          Read up to `NR * NC' elements, returning a matrix with NR rows.  If the number of elements read is not an exact multiple of NR, the last column is padded with zeros.

     If SIZE is omitted, a value of `Inf' is assumed.

     A string is returned if TEMPLATE specifies only character conversions.

     The number of items successfully read is returned in COUNT.

     In the second form, read from FID according to TEMPLATE, with each conversion specifier in TEMPLATE corresponding to a single scalar return value.  This form is more `C-like', and also compatible with previous versions of Octave.  The number of successful conversions is returned in COUNT

     If SIZE is omitted, a value of `Inf' is assumed.

     The optional argument PRECISION is a string specifying the type of data to read and may be one of

    `"schar"'
    `"signed char"'
          Signed character.

    `"uchar"'
    `"unsigned char"'
          Unsigned character.

    `"int8"'
    `"integer*1"'
          8-bit signed integer.

    `"int16"'
    `"integer*2"'
          16-bit signed integer.

          32-bit floating point number.

    `"double"'
    `"float64"'
    `"real*8"'
          64-bit floating point number.

    `"char"'
    `"char*1"'
          Single character.

    `"short"'
          Short integer (size is platform dependent).

    `"int"'
          Integer (size is platform dependent).

    `"long"'
          Long integer (size is platform dependent).

    `"ushort"'
    `"unsigned short"'
          Unsigned short integer (size is platform dependent).

    `"unsigned int"'
          Unsigned integer (size is platform dependent).

    `"ulong"'
    `"unsigned long"'
          Unsigned long integer (size is platform dependent).

    `"float"'
          Single precision floating point number (size is platform dependent).

     The default precision is `"uchar"'.

     The PRECISION argument may also specify an optional repeat count.  For example, `32*single' causes `fread' to read a block of 32 single precision floating point numbers.  Reading in blocks is useful in combination with the SKIP argument.

     The PRECISION argument may also specify a type conversion.  For example, `int16=>int32' causes `fread' to read 16-bit integer values and return an array of 32-bit integer values.  By default, `fread' returns a double precision array.  The special form `*TYPE' is shorthand for `TYPE=>TYPE'.

     The conversion and repeat counts may be combined.  For example, the specification `32*single=>single' causes `fread' to read blocks of single precision floating point values and return an array of single precision values instead of the default array of double precision values.

     The optional argument SKIP specifies the number of bytes to skip after each element (or block of elements) is read.  If it is not specified, a value of 0 is assumed.  If the final block read is not complete, the final skip is omitted.  For example,

          fread (f, 10, "3*single=>single", 8)

     will omit the final 8-byte skip because the last read will not be a complete block of 3 values.

     The optional argument ARCH is a string specifying the data format for the file.  Valid values are

    `"native"'
          The format of the current machine.

    `"ieee-be"'
          IEEE big endian.

    `"ieee-le"'
          IEEE little endian.

    `"vaxd"'
          VAX D floating format.

    `"vaxg"'
          VAX G floating format.

    `"cray"'
          Cray floating format.

     Conversions are currently only supported for `"ieee-be"' and `"ieee-le"' formats.

     The data read from the file is returned in VAL, and the number of values read is returned in `count' See also: fwrite, fopen, fclose.

     If PREFIX is omitted, a value of `"oct-"' is used.  If DIR is also omitted, the default directory for temporary files is used.  If DIR is provided, it must exist, otherwise the default directory for temporary files is used.  Since the named file is not opened, by `tmpnam', it is possible (though relatively unlikely) that it will not be available by the time your program attempts to open it.

 -- Built-in Function: [FID, NAME, MSG] = mkstemp (TEMPLATE, DELETE)
     Return the file ID corresponding to a new temporary file with a unique name created from TEMPLATE.  The last six characters of TEMPLATE must be `XXXXXX' and these are replaced with a string that makes the filename unique.  The file is then created with mode read/write and permissions that are system dependent (on GNU/Linux systems, the permissions will be 0600 for versions of glibc 2.0.7 and later).  The file is opened with the `O_EXCL' flag.

     If the optional argument DELETE is supplied and is true, the file will be deleted automatically when Octave exits, or when the function `purge_tmp_files' is called.

     If successful, FID is a valid file ID, NAME is the name of the file, and MSG is an empty string.  Otherwise, FID is -1, NAME is empty, and MSG contains a system-dependent error message.  See also: tmpfile, tmpnam, P_tmpdir.

            y(n) = - SUM c(k+1) y(n-k) + SUM d(k+1) x(n-k)  for 1<=n<=length(x)

     where  c = a/a(1) and d = b/a(1).

     If the fourth argument SI is provided, it is taken as the initial state of the system and the final state is returned as SF.  The state vector is a column vector whose length is equal to the length of the longest coefficient vector minus one.  If SI is not supplied, the initial state vector is set to all zeros.

 -- Loadable Function:  find (X)
 -- Loadable Function:  find (X, N)
 -- Loadable Function:  find (X, N, DIRECTION)
     Return a vector of indices of nonzero elements of a matrix, as a row if X is a row or as a column otherwise.  To obtain a single index for each matrix element, Octave pretends that the columns of a matrix form one long vector (like Fortran arrays are stored).  For example,

          find (eye (2))
               => [ 1; 4 ]

     If two outputs are requested, `find' returns the row and column indices of nonzero elements of a matrix.  For example,

          [i, j] = find (2 * eye (2))
               => i = [ 1; 2 ]
               => j = [ 1; 2 ]

     If three outputs are requested, `find' also returns a vector containing the nonzero values.  For example,

          [i, j, v] = find (3 * eye (2))
               => i = [ 1; 2 ]
               => j = [ 1; 2 ]
               => v = [ 3; 3 ]

     If two inputs are given, N indicates the maximum number of elements to find from the beginning of the matrix or vector.

     If three inputs are given, DIRECTION should be one of "first" or "last", requesting only the first or last N indices, respectively.  However, the indices are always returned in ascending order.

     Note that this function is particularly useful for sparse matrices, as it extracts the non-zero elements as vectors, which can then be used to create the original matrix.  For example,

          sz = size(a);
          [i, j, v] = find (a);
          b = sparse(i, j, v, sz(1), sz(2));

     with the limiting value of 1 as X approaches infinity.  The standard notation is P(a,x), e.g., Abramowitz and Stegun (6.5.1).

     If A is scalar, then `gammainc (X, A)' is returned for each element of X and vice versa.

     If neither X nor A is scalar, the sizes of X and A must agree, and GAMMAINC is applied element-by-element.  See also: gamma, lgamma.

 -- Loadable Function: G = gcd (A)
 -- Loadable Function: G = gcd (A1, A2, ...)
 -- Loadable Function: [G, V1, ...] = gcd (A1, A2, ...)
     Compute the greatest common divisor of the elements of A.  If more than one argument is given all arguments must be the same size or scalar.    In this case the greatest common divisor is calculated for each element individually.  All elements must be integers.  For example,

          gcd ([15, 20])
              =>  5

     and

          gcd ([15, 9], [20, 18])
              =>  5  9

     Optional return arguments V1, etc., contain integer vectors such that,

          G = V1 .* A1 + V2 .* A2 + ...

     For backward compatibility with previous versions of this function, when all arguments are scalar, a single return argument V1 containing all of the values of V1, ... is acceptable.  See also: lcm, factor.

If FCN is a function handle, the corresponding function should accept at least 2 arguments, that will be set to the object handle and the empty matrix respectively.  If FCN is a string, it must be any valid octave expression.  If FCN is a cell array, the first element must be a function handle with the same signature as described above.  The next elements of the cell array are passed as additional arguments to the function.

     Example:

          function my_listener (h, dummy, p1)
            fprintf ("my_listener called with p1=%s\n", p1);
          endfunction

          addlistener (gcf, "position", {@my_listener, "my string"})

 -- Built-in Function:  dellistener (H, PROP, FCN)
     Remove the registration of FCN as a listener for the property PROP of the graphics object H.  The function FCN must be the same variable (not just the same value), as was passed to the original call to `addlistener'.

     If FCN is not defined then all listener functions of PROP are removed.

     Example:

          function my_listener (h, dummy, p1)
            fprintf ("my_listener called with p1=%s\n", p1);

 -- Built-in Function:  addproperty (NAME, H, TYPE, [ARG, ...])
     Create a new property named NAME in graphics object H.  TYPE determines the type of the property to create.  ARGS usually contains the default value of the property, but additional arguments might be given, depending on the type of the property.

     The supported property types are:

    `string'
          A string property.  ARG contains the default string value.

    `any'
          An un-typed property.  This kind of property can hold any octave value.  ARGS contains the default value.

    `radio'
          A string property with a limited set of accepted values.  The first argument must be a string with all accepted values separated by a vertical bar ('|').  The default value can be marked by enclosing it with a '{' '}' pair.  The default value may also be given as an optional second string argument.

    `boolean'
          A boolean property.  This property type is equivalent to a radio property with "on|off" as accepted values.  ARG contains the default property value.

    `double'
          A scalar double property.  ARG contains the default value.

    `handle'
          A handle property.  This kind of property holds the handle of a graphics object.  ARG contains the default handle value.  When no default value is given, the property is initialized to the empty matrix.

    `data'
          A data (matrix) property.  ARG contains the default data value.  When no default value is given, the data is initialized to the empty matrix.

    `color'
          A color property.  ARG contains the default color value.  When no default color is given, the property is set to black.  An optional second string argument may be given to specify an additional set of accepted string values (like a radio property).

     TYPE may also be the concatenation of a core object type and a valid property name for that object type.  The property created then has the same characteristics as the referenced property (type, possible values, hidden state...).  This allows to clone an existing property into the graphics object H.

     Examples:

          addproperty ("my_property", gcf, "string", "a string value");
          addproperty ("my_radio", gcf, "radio", "val_1|val_2|{val_3}");
          addproperty ("my_style", gcf, "linelinestyle", "--");

     Compute the Hessenberg decomposition of the matrix A.

     The Hessenberg decomposition is usually used as the first step in an eigenvalue computation, but has other applications as well (see Golub, Nash, and Van Loan, IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 1979).  The Hessenberg decomposition is `p * h * p' = a' where `p' is a square unitary matrix (`p' * p = I', using complex-conjugate transposition) and `h' is upper Hessenberg (`i >= j+1 => h (i, j) = 0').

 -- Built-in Function:  input (PROMPT)
 -- Built-in Function:  input (PROMPT, "s")
     Print a prompt and wait for user input.  For example,

          input ("Pick a number, any number! ")

     prints the prompt

          Pick a number, any number!

     and waits for the user to enter a value.  The string entered by the user is evaluated as an expression, so it may be a literal constant, a variable name, or any other valid expression.

     Currently, `input' only returns one value, regardless of the number of values produced by the evaluation of the expression.

     If you are only interested in getting a literal string value, you can call `input' with the character string `"s"' as the second argument.  This tells Octave to return the string entered by the user directly, without evaluating it first.

     Because there may be output waiting to be displayed by the pager, it is a good idea to always call `fflush (stdout)' before calling `input'.  This will ensure that all pending output is written to the screen before your prompt.  *Note Input and Output::.

 -- Built-in Function:  keyboard ()
 -- Built-in Function:  keyboard (PROMPT)
     This function is normally used for simple debugging.  When the `keyboard' function is executed, Octave prints a prompt and waits for user input.  The input strings are then evaluated and the results are printed.  This makes it possible to examine the values of variables within a function, and to assign new values if necessary.  To leave the prompt and return to normal execution type `return' or `dbcont'.  The `keyboard' function does not return an exit status.

     If `keyboard' is invoked without arguments, a default prompt of `debug> ' is used.  See also: dbcont, dbquit.

     returns the help string associated with the sub-function `mysubfunc' of the function `myfunc'.  Another use of `filemarker' is when debugging it allows easier placement of breakpoints within sub-functions.  For example

          dbstop (["myfunc", filemarker, "mysubfunc"])

     will set a breakpoint at the first line of the subfunction `mysubfunc'.

 -- Command: load file
 -- Command: load options file
 -- Command: load options file v1 v2 ...
 -- Command: S = load("options", "file", "v1", "v2", ...)
     Load the named variables V1, V2, ..., from the file FILE.  If no variables are specified then all variables found in the file will be loaded.  As with `save', the list of variables to extract can be full names or use a pattern syntax.  The format of the file is automatically detected but may be overridden by supplying the appropriate option.

     If load is invoked using the functional form

          load ("-option1", ..., "file", "v1", ...)

     then the OPTIONS, FILE, and variable name arguments (V1, ...) must be specified as character strings.

     If a variable that is not marked as global is loaded from a file when a global symbol with the same name already exists, it is loaded in the global symbol table.  Also, if a variable is marked as global in a file and a local symbol exists, the local symbol is moved to the global symbol table and given the value from the file.

     If invoked with a single output argument, Octave returns data instead of inserting variables in the symbol table.  If the data file contains only numbers (TAB- or space-delimited columns), a matrix of values is returned.  Otherwise, `load' returns a structure with members  corresponding to the names of the variables in the file.

     The `load' command can read data stored in Octave's text and binary formats, and MATLAB's binary format.  If compiled with zlib support, it can also load gzip-compressed files.  It will automatically detect the type of file and do conversion from different floating point formats (currently only IEEE big and little endian, though other formats may be added in the future).

     Valid options for `load' are listed in the following table.

    `-force'
          This option is accepted for backward compatibility but is ignored.  Octave now overwrites variables currently in memory with those of the same name found in the file.

    `-ascii'
          Force Octave to assume the file contains columns of numbers in text format without any header or other information.  Data in the file will be loaded as a single numeric matrix with the name of the variable derived from the name of the file.

    `-binary'
          Force Octave to assume the file is in Octave's binary format.

    `-hdf5'
          Force Octave to assume the file is in HDF5 format.  (HDF5 is a free, portable binary format developed by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois.)  Note that Octave can read HDF5 files not created by itself, but may skip some datasets in formats that it cannot support.

    `-import'
          This option is accepted for backward compatibility but is ignored.  Octave can now support multi-dimensional HDF data and automatically modifies variable names if they are invalid Octave identifiers.

    `-mat'
    `-mat-binary'
    `-6'
    `-v6'
    `-7'
    `-v7'
          Force Octave to assume the file is in MATLAB's version 6 or 7 binary format.

    `-mat4-binary'
    `-4'
    `-v4'
    `-V4'
          Force Octave to assume the file is in the binary format written by MATLAB version 4.

    `-text'
          Force Octave to assume the file is in Octave's text format.

 -- Command: save file
 -- Command: save options file
 -- Command: save options file V1 V2 ...
 -- Command: save options file -struct STRUCT F1 F2 ...
     Save the named variables V1, V2, ..., in the file FILE.  The special filename `-' may be used to write output to the terminal.  If no variable names are listed, Octave saves all the variables in the current scope.  Otherwise, full variable names or pattern syntax can be used to specify the variables to save.  If the `-struct' modifier is used, fields F1 F2 ...  of the scalar structure STRUCT are saved as if they were variables with corresponding names.  Valid options for the `save' command are listed in the following table.  Options that modify the output format override the format specified by `default_save_options'.

     If save is invoked using the functional form

          save ("-option1", ..., "file", "v1", ...)

     then the OPTIONS, FILE, and variable name arguments (V1, ...) must be specified as character strings.

    `-ascii'
          Save a single matrix in a text file without header or any other information.

    `-binary'
          Save the data in Octave's binary data format.

    `-float-binary'
          Save the data in Octave's binary data format but only using single precision.  Only use this format if you know that all the values to be saved can be represented in single precision.

    `-hdf5'
          Save the data in HDF5 format.  (HDF5 is a free, portable binary format developed by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois.)

    `-float-hdf5'
          Save the data in HDF5 format but only using single precision.  Only use this format if you know that all the values to be saved can be represented in single precision.

    `-V7'
    `-v7'
    `-7'
    `-mat7-binary'
          Save the data in MATLAB's v7 binary data format.

    `-V6'
    `-v6'
    `-6'
    `-mat'
    `-mat-binary'
          Save the data in MATLAB's v6 binary data format.

    `-V4'
    `-v4'
    `-4'
    `-mat4-binary'
          Save the data in the binary format written by MATLAB version 4.

    `-text'
          Save the data in Octave's text data format.  (default).

    `-zip'
    `-z'
          Use the gzip algorithm to compress the file.  This works equally on files that are compressed with gzip outside of octave, and gzip can equally be used to convert the files for backward compatibility.

     The list of variables to save may use wildcard patterns containing the following special characters:
    `?'
          Match any single character.

    `*'
          Match zero or more characters.

    `[ LIST ]'
          Match the list of characters specified by LIST.  If the first character is `!' or `^', match all characters except those specified by LIST.  For example, the pattern `[a-zA-Z]' will match all lower and upper case alphabetic characters.

          Wildcards may also be used in the field name specifications when using the `-struct' modifier (but not in the struct name itself).


     Except when using the MATLAB binary data file format or the `-ascii' format, saving global variables also saves the global status of the variable.  If the variable is restored at a later time using `load', it will be restored as a global variable.

     The command

          save -binary data a b*

     saves the variable `a' and all variables beginning with `b' to the file `data' in Octave's binary format.  See also: load, default_save_options, dlmread, csvread, fread.

 -- Loadable Function: IDX = lookup (TABLE, Y, OPT)
     Lookup values in a sorted table.  Usually used as a prelude to interpolation.

     If table is strictly increasing and `idx = lookup (table, y)', then `table(idx(i)) <= y(i) < table(idx(i+1))' for all `y(i)' within the table.  If `y(i) < table (1)' then `idx(i)' is 0. If `y(i) >= table(end)' then `idx(i)' is `table(n)'.

     If the table is strictly decreasing, then the tests are reversed.  There are no guarantees for tables which are non-monotonic or are not strictly monotonic.

     The algorithm used by lookup is standard binary search, with optimizations to speed up the case of partially ordered arrays (dense downsampling).  In particular, looking up a single entry is of logarithmic complexity (unless a conversion occurs due to non-numeric or unequal types).

     TABLE and Y can also be cell arrays of strings (or Y can be a single string).  In this case, string lookup is performed using lexicographical comparison.

     If OPTS is specified, it shall be a string with letters indicating additional options.  For numeric lookup, 'l' in OPTS indicates that the leftmost subinterval shall be extended to infinity (i.e., all indices at least 1), and 'r' indicates that the rightmost subinterval shall be extended to infinity (i.e., all indices at most n-1).

     For string lookup, 'i' indicates case-insensitive comparison.

 -- Loadable Function:  lsode_options (OPT, VAL)
     When called with two arguments, this function allows you set options parameters for the function `lsode'.  Given one argument, `lsode_options' returns the value of the corresponding option.  If no arguments are supplied, the names of all the available options and their current values are displayed.

     Options include

    `"absolute tolerance"'
          Absolute tolerance.  May be either vector or scalar.  If a vector, it must match the dimension of the state vector.

    `"relative tolerance"'
          Relative tolerance parameter.  Unlike the absolute tolerance, this parameter may only be a scalar.

          The local error test applied at each integration step is

                 abs (local error in x(i)) <= ...
                     rtol * abs (y(i)) + atol(i)

    `"integration method"'
          A string specifying the method of integration to use to solve the ODE system.  Valid values are

         "adams"
         "non-stiff"
               No Jacobian used (even if it is available).

         "bdf"

         "stiff"
               Use stiff backward differentiation formula (BDF) method.  If a function to compute the Jacobian is not supplied, `lsode' will compute a finite difference approximation of the Jacobian matrix.

    `"initial step size"'
          The step size to be attempted on the first step (default is determined automatically).

    `"maximum order"'
          Restrict the maximum order of the solution method.  If using the Adams method, this option must be between 1 and 12.  Otherwise, it must be between 1 and 5, inclusive.

    `"maximum step size"'
          Setting the maximum stepsize will avoid passing over very large regions  (default is not specified).

    `"minimum step size"'
          The minimum absolute step size allowed (default is 0).

    `"step limit"'
          Maximum number of steps allowed (default is 100000).

     The second and third arguments specify the initial state of the system, x_0, and the initial value of the independent variable t_0.

     The fourth argument is optional, and may be used to specify a set of times that the ODE solver should not integrate past.  It is useful for avoiding difficulties with singularities and points where there is a discontinuity in the derivative.

     After a successful computation, the value of ISTATE will be 2 (consistent with the Fortran version of LSODE).

     If the computation is not successful, ISTATE will be something other than 2 and MSG will contain additional information.

     You can use the function `lsode_options' to set optional parameters for `lsode'.  See also: daspk, dassl, dasrt.

     Compute the LU decomposition of A.  If A is full subroutines from LAPACK are used and if A is sparse then UMFPACK is used.  The result is returned in a permuted form, according to the optional return value P.  For example, given the matrix `a = [1, 2; 3, 4]',

     The matrix is not required to be square.

     Called with two or three output arguments and a spare input matrix, then "lu" does not attempt to perform sparsity preserving column permutations.  Called with a fourth output argument, the sparsity preserving column transformation Q is returned, such that `P * A * Q = L * U'.

     Called with a fifth output argument and a sparse input matrix, then "lu" attempts to use a scaling factor R on the input matrix such that `P * (R \ A) * Q = L * U'.  This typically leads to a sparser and more stable factorization.

     An additional input argument THRES, that defines the pivoting threshold can be given.  THRES can be a scalar, in which case it defines UMFPACK pivoting tolerance for both symmetric and unsymmetric cases.  If THRES is a two element vector, then the first element defines the pivoting tolerance for the unsymmetric UMFPACK pivoting strategy and the second the symmetric strategy.  By default, the values defined by `spparms' are used and are by default `[0.1, 0.001]'.

     Given the string argument 'vector', "lu" returns the values of P Q as vector values, such that for full matrix, `A (P,:) = L * U', and `R(P,:) * A (:, Q) = L * U'.

     With two output arguments, returns the permuted forms of the upper and lower triangular matrices, such that `A = L * U'.  With one output argument Y, then the matrix returned by the LAPACK routines is returned.  If the input matrix is sparse then the matrix L is embedded into U to give a return value similar to the full case.  For both full and sparse matrices, "lu" looses the permutation information.

     Produce the incomplete LU factorization of the sparse matrix A.  Two types of incomplete factorization are possible, and the type is determined by the second argument to "luinc".

     Called with a second argument of '0', the zero-level incomplete LU factorization is produced.  This creates a factorization of A where the position of the non-zero arguments correspond to the same positions as in the matrix A.

     Alternatively, the fill-in of the incomplete LU factorization can be controlled through the variable DROPTOL or the structure OPTS.  The UMFPACK multifrontal factorization code by Tim A.  Davis is used for the incomplete LU factorization, (availability `http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/umfpack/')

     DROPTOL determines the values below which the values in the LU factorization are dropped and replaced by zero.  It must be a positive scalar, and any values in the factorization whose absolute value are less than this value are dropped, expect if leaving them increase the sparsity of the matrix.  Setting DROPTOL to zero results in a complete LU factorization which is the default.

     OPTS is a structure containing one or more of the fields

    `droptol'
          The drop tolerance as above.  If OPTS only contains `droptol' then this is equivalent to using the variable DROPTOL.

    `milu'
          A logical variable flagging whether to use the modified incomplete LU factorization.  In the case that `milu' is true, the dropped values are subtracted from the diagonal of the matrix U of the factorization.  The default is `false'.

    `udiag'
          A logical variable that flags whether zero elements on the diagonal of U should be replaced with DROPTOL to attempt to avoid singular factors.  The default is `false'.

    `thresh'
          Defines the pivot threshold in the interval [0,1].  Values outside that range are ignored.

     All other fields in OPTS are ignored.  The outputs from "luinc" are the same as for "lu".

     Given the string argument 'vector', "luinc" returns the values of P Q as vector values.  See also: sparse, lu.

 -- Loadable Function: A = matrix_type (A, 'banded', NL, NU)
     Identify the matrix type or mark a matrix as a particular type.  This allows rapid for solutions of linear equations involving A to be performed.  Called with a single argument, `matrix_type' returns the type of the matrix and caches it for future use.  Called with more than one argument, `matrix_type' allows the type of the matrix to be defined.

     The possible matrix types depend on whether the matrix is full or sparse, and can be one of the following

    'unknown'
          Remove any previously cached matrix type, and mark type as unknown

    'full'
          Mark the matrix as full.

    'positive definite'
          Probable full positive definite matrix.

    'diagonal'
          Diagonal Matrix.  (Sparse matrices only)

    'permuted diagonal'
          Permuted Diagonal matrix.  The permutation does not need to be specifically indicated, as the structure of the matrix explicitly gives this.  (Sparse matrices only)

    'upper'
          Upper triangular.  If the optional third argument PERM is given, the matrix is assumed to be a permuted upper triangular with the permutations defined by the vector PERM.

    'lower'
          Lower triangular.  If the optional third argument PERM is given, the matrix is assumed to be a permuted lower triangular with the permutations defined by the vector PERM.

    'banded'
    'banded positive definite'
          Banded matrix with the band size of NL below the diagonal and NU above it.  If NL and NU are 1, then the matrix is tridiagonal and treated with specialized code.  In addition the matrix can be marked as probably a positive definite (Sparse matrices only)

    'singular'
          The matrix is assumed to be singular and will be treated with a minimum norm solution


     Note that the matrix type will be discovered automatically on the first attempt to solve a linear equation involving A.  Therefore `matrix_type' is only useful to give Octave hints of the matrix type.  Incorrectly defining the matrix type will result in incorrect results from solutions of linear equations, and so it is entirely the responsibility of the user to correctly identify the matrix type.

     Also the test for positive definiteness is a low-cost test for a hermitian matrix with a real positive diagonal.  This does not guarantee that the matrix is positive definite, but only that it is a probable candidate.  When such a matrix is factorized, a Cholesky factorization is first attempted, and if that fails the matrix is then treated with an LU factorization.  Once the matrix has been factorized, `matrix_type' will return the correct classification of the matrix.

 -- Command: edit_history [FIRST] [LAST]
     If invoked with no arguments, `edit_history' allows you to edit the history list using the editor named by the variable `EDITOR'.  The commands to be edited are first copied to a temporary file.  When you exit the editor, Octave executes the commands that remain in the file.  It is often more convenient to use `edit_history' to define functions rather than attempting to enter them directly on the command line.  By default, the block of commands is executed as soon as you exit the editor.  To avoid executing any commands, simply delete all the lines from the buffer before exiting the editor.

     The `edit_history' command takes two optional arguments specifying the history numbers of first and last commands to edit.  For example, the command

          edit_history 13

     extracts all the commands from the 13th through the last in the history list.  The command

          edit_history 13 169

     only extracts commands 13 through 169.  Specifying a larger number for the first command than the last command reverses the list of commands before placing them in the buffer to be edited.  If both arguments are omitted, the previous command in the history list is used.  See also: run_history.

 -- Command: history options
     If invoked with no arguments, `history' displays a list of commands that you have executed.  Valid options are:

    `-w FILE'
          Write the current history to the file FILE.  If the name is omitted, use the default history file (normally `~/.octave_hist').

    `-r FILE'
          Read the file FILE, replacing the current history list with its contents.  If the name is omitted, use the default history file (normally `~/.octave_hist').

    `N'
          Display only the most recent N lines of history.

    `-q'
          Don't number the displayed lines of history.  This is useful for cutting and pasting commands using the X Window System.

     For example, to display the five most recent commands that you have typed without displaying line numbers, use the command `history -q 5'.

     Within a function, return the number of values the caller expects to receive.  If called with the optional argument FCN_NAME, return the maximum number of values the named function can produce, or -1 if the function can produce a variable number of values.

     For example,

          f ()

     will cause `nargout' to return 0 inside the function `f' and

          [s, t] = f ()

     will cause `nargout' to return 2 inside the function `f'.

     At the top level, `nargout' is undefined.  See also: nargin, varargin, varargout.

# name: <cell-element>
# type: string
# elements: 1
# length: 985
 -- Built-in Function:  autoload (FUNCTION, FILE)
     Define FUNCTION to autoload from FILE.

     The second argument, FILE, should be an absolute file name or a file name in the same directory as the function or script from which the autoload command was run.  FILE should not depend on the Octave load path.

     Normally, calls to `autoload' appear in PKG_ADD script files that are evaluated when a directory is added to the Octave's load path.  To avoid having to hardcode directory names in FILE, if FILE is in the same directory as the PKG_ADD script then

          autoload ("foo", "bar.oct");

     will load the function `foo' from the file `bar.oct'.  The above when `bar.oct' is not in the same directory or uses like

          autoload ("foo", file_in_loadpath ("bar.oct"))

     are strongly discouraged, as their behavior might be unpredictable.

     With no arguments, return a structure containing the current autoload map.  See also: PKG_ADD.

     Return the name of the currently executing file.  At the top-level, return the empty string.  Given the argument `"fullpath"', include the directory part of the file name, but not the extension.  Given the argument `"fullpathext"', include the directory part of the file name and the extension.

# length: 5
feval
# name: <cell-element>
# type: string
# elements: 1
# length: 675
 -- Built-in Function:  feval (NAME, ...)
     Evaluate the function named NAME.  Any arguments after the first are passed on to the named function.  For example,

          feval ("acos", -1)
               => 3.1416

     calls the function `acos' with the argument `-1'.

     The function `feval' is necessary in order to be able to write functions that call user-supplied functions, because Octave does not have a way to declare a pointer to a function (like C) or to declare a special kind of variable that can be used to hold the name of a function (like `EXTERNAL' in Fortran).  Instead, you must refer to functions by name, and use `feval' to call them.

# length: 4
eval
# name: <cell-element>
# type: string
# elements: 1
# length: 737
 -- Built-in Function:  eval (TRY, CATCH)
     Parse the string TRY and evaluate it as if it were an Octave program.  If that fails, evaluate the optional string CATCH.  The string TRY is evaluated in the current context, so any results remain available after `eval' returns.

     The following example makes the variable A with the approximate value 3.1416 available.

          eval("a = acos(-1);");

     If an error occurs during the evaluation of TRY the CATCH string is evaluated, as the following example shows:

          eval ('error ("This is a bad example");',
                'printf ("This error occurred:\n%s\n", lasterr ());');
               -| This error occurred:
                  This is a bad example

     Return the pseudoinverse of X.  Singular values less than TOL are ignored.

     If the second argument is omitted, it is assumed that

          tol = max (size (X)) * sigma_max (X) * eps,

     where `sigma_max (X)' is the maximal singular value of X.

     Convert X into a rational approximation represented as a string.  You can convert the string back into a matrix as follows:

             r = rats(hilb(4));
             x = str2num(r)

     The optional second argument defines the maximum length of the string representing the elements of X.  By default LEN is 9.  See also: format, rat.

 -- Built-in Function:  disp (X)
     Display the value of X.  For example,

          disp ("The value of pi is:"), disp (pi)

               -| the value of pi is:
               -| 3.1416

     Note that the output from `disp' always ends with a newline.

     If an output value is requested, `disp' prints nothing and returns the formatted output in a string.  See also: fdisp.

 -- Command: format
 -- Command: format options
     Reset or specify the format of the output produced by `disp' and Octave's normal echoing mechanism.  This command only affects the display of numbers but not how they are stored or computed.  To change the internal representation from the default double use one of the conversion functions such as `single', `uint8', `int64', etc.

     By default, Octave displays 5 significant digits in a human readable form (option `short' paired with `loose' format for matrices).  If `format' is invoked without any options, this default format is restored.

     Valid formats for floating point numbers are listed in the following table.

    `short'
          Fixed point format with 5 significant figures in a field that is a maximum of 10 characters wide.  (default).

          If Octave is unable to format a matrix so that columns line up on the decimal point and all numbers fit within the maximum field width then it switches to an exponential `e' format.

    `long'
          Fixed point format with 15 significant figures in a field that is a maximum of 20 characters wide.

          As with the `short' format, Octave will switch to an exponential `e' format if it is unable to format a matrix properly using the current format.

    `short e'
    `long e'
          Exponential format.  The number to be represented is split between a mantissa and an exponent (power of 10).  The mantissa has 5 significant digits in the short format and 15 digits in the long format.  For example, with the `short e' format, `pi' is displayed as `3.1416e+00'.

    `short E'
    `long E'
          Identical to `short e' or `long e' but displays an uppercase `E' to indicate the exponent.  For example, with the `long E' format, `pi' is displayed as `3.14159265358979E+00'.

    `short g'
    `long g'
          Optimally choose between fixed point and exponential format based on the magnitude of the number.  For example, with the `short g' format, `pi .^ [2; 4; 8; 16; 32]' is displayed as

               ans =

                     9.8696
                     97.409
                     9488.5
                 9.0032e+07
                 8.1058e+15

    `long G'
    `short G'
          Identical to `short g' or `long g' but displays an uppercase `E' to indicate the exponent.

    `free'
    `none'
          Print output in free format, without trying to line up columns of matrices on the decimal point.  This also causes complex numbers to be formatted as numeric pairs like this `(0.60419, 0.60709)' instead of like this `0.60419 + 0.60709i'.

     The following formats affect all numeric output (floating point and integer types).

    `+'
    `+ CHARS'
    `plus'
    `plus CHARS'
          Print a `+' symbol for nonzero matrix elements and a space for zero matrix elements.  This format can be very useful for examining the structure of a large sparse matrix.

          The optional argument CHARS specifies a list of 3 characters to use for printing values greater than zero, less than zero and equal to zero.  For example, with the `+ "+-."' format, `[1, 0, -1; -1, 0, 1]' is displayed as

               ans =

               +.-
               -.+

    `bank'
          Print in a fixed format with two digits to the right of the decimal point.

    `native-hex'
          Print the hexadecimal representation of numbers as they are stored in memory.  For example, on a workstation which stores 8 byte real values in IEEE format with the least significant byte first, the value of `pi' when printed in `native-hex' format is `400921fb54442d18'.

    `hex'
          The same as `native-hex', but always print the most significant byte first.

    `native-bit'
          Print the bit representation of numbers as stored in memory.  For example, the value of `pi' is

               01000000000010010010000111111011
               01010100010001000010110100011000

          (shown here in two 32 bit sections for typesetting purposes) when printed in native-bit format on a workstation which stores 8 byte real values in IEEE format with the least significant byte first.

    `bit'
          The same as `native-bit', but always print the most significant bits first.

    `rat'
          Print a rational approximation, i.e., values are approximated as the ratio of small integers.  For example, with the `rat' format, `pi' is displayed as `355/113'.

     The following two options affect the display of all matrices.

    `compact'
          Remove extra blank space around column number labels producing more compact output with more data per page.

    `loose'
          Insert blank lines above and below column number labels to produce a more readable output with less data per page.  (default).

 -- Loadable Function: [Q, R, P] = qr (A)
 -- Loadable Function: [Q, R, P] = qr (A, '0')
     Compute the QR factorization of A, using standard LAPACK subroutines.  For example, given the matrix `a = [1, 2; 3, 4]',

          [q, r] = qr (a)

     returns

            -3.16228  -4.42719
             0.00000  -0.63246

     The `qr' factorization has applications in the solution of least squares problems

          `min norm(A x - b)'

     for overdetermined systems of equations (i.e., `a'  is a tall, thin matrix).  The QR factorization is `q * r = a' where `q' is an orthogonal matrix and `r' is upper triangular.

     If given a second argument of '0', `qr' returns an economy-sized QR factorization, omitting zero rows of R and the corresponding columns of Q.

     If the matrix A is full, the permuted QR factorization `[Q, R, P] = qr (A)' forms the QR factorization such that the diagonal entries of `r' are decreasing in magnitude order.  For example,given the matrix `a = [1, 2; 3, 4]',

          [q, r, p] = qr(a)

     returns

          q =

          p =

             0  1
             1  0

     The permuted `qr' factorization `[q, r, p] = qr (a)' factorization allows the construction of an orthogonal basis of `span (a)'.

     If the matrix A is sparse, then compute the sparse QR factorization of A, using CSPARSE.  As the matrix Q is in general a full matrix, this function returns the Q-less factorization R of A, such that `R = chol (A' * A)'.

     If the final argument is the scalar `0' and the number of rows is larger than the number of columns, then an economy factorization is returned.  That is R will have only `size (A,1)' rows.

     If an additional matrix B is supplied, then `qr' returns C, where `C = Q' * B'.  This allows the least squares approximation of `A \ B' to be calculated as

          [C,R] = spqr (A,B)
          X = R \ C

 -- Loadable Function: [V, IER, NFUN, ERR] = quad (F, A, B, TOL, SING)
     Integrate a nonlinear function of one variable using Quadpack.  The first argument is the name of the function, the function handle or the inline function to call to compute the value of the integrand.  It must have the form

          y = f (x)

     where Y and X are scalars.

     The second and third arguments are limits of integration.  Either or both may be infinite.

     The optional argument TOL is a vector that specifies the desired accuracy of the result.  The first element of the vector is the desired absolute tolerance, and the second element is the desired relative tolerance.  To choose a relative test only, set the absolute tolerance to zero.  To choose an absolute test only, set the relative tolerance to zero.

     The optional argument SING is a vector of values at which the integrand is known to be singular.

     The result of the integration is returned in V and IER contains an integer error code (0 indicates a successful integration).  The value of NFUN indicates how many function evaluations were required, and ERR contains an estimate of the error in the solution.

     You can use the function `quad_options' to set optional parameters for `quad'.

     It should be noted that since `quad' is written in Fortran it cannot be called recursively.

 -- Loadable Function:  rand ("seed", X)
     Return a matrix with random elements uniformly distributed on the interval (0, 1).  The arguments are handled the same as the arguments for `eye'.

     You can query the state of the random number generator using the form

          v = rand ("state")

     This returns a column vector V of length 625.  Later, you can restore the random number generator to the state V using the form

          rand ("state", v)

     You may also initialize the state vector from an arbitrary vector of length <= 625 for V.  This new state will be a hash based on the value of V, not V itself.

     By default, the generator is initialized from `/dev/urandom' if it is available, otherwise from cpu time, wall clock time and the current fraction of a second.

     To compute the pseudo-random sequence, `rand' uses the Mersenne Twister with a period of 2^19937-1 (See M. Matsumoto and T. Nishimura, `Mersenne Twister: A 623-dimensionally equidistributed uniform pseudorandom number generator', ACM Trans. on Modeling and Computer Simulation Vol. 8, No. 1, January pp.3-30 1998, `http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/emt.html').  Do *not* use for cryptography without securely hashing several returned values together, otherwise the generator state can be learned after reading 624 consecutive values.

     Older versions of Octave used a different random number generator.  The new generator is used by default as it is significantly faster than the old generator, and produces random numbers with a significantly longer cycle time.  However, in some circumstances it might be desirable to obtain the same random sequences as used by the old generators.  To do this the keyword "seed" is used to specify that the old generators should be use, as in

          rand ("seed", val)

     which sets the seed of the generator to VAL.  The seed of the generator can be queried with

          s = rand ("seed")

     However, it should be noted that querying the seed will not cause `rand' to use the old generators, only setting the seed will.  To cause `rand' to once again use the new generators, the keyword "state" should be used to reset the state of the `rand'.  See also: randn, rande, randg, randp.

     Return a matrix with Poisson distributed random elements with mean value parameter given by the first argument, L.  The arguments are handled the same as the arguments for `rand', except for the argument L.

     Five different algorithms are used depending on the range of L and whether or not L is a scalar or a matrix.

    For scalar L <= 12, use direct method.

    For scalar L > 12, use rejection method.[1]
          Press, et al., 'Numerical Recipes in C', Cambridge University Press, 1992.

    For matrix L <= 10, use inversion method.[2]

     Compute the 1-norm estimate of the reciprocal condition as returned by LAPACK.  If the matrix is well-conditioned then C will be near 1 and if the matrix is poorly conditioned it will be close to zero.

     The matrix A must not be sparse.  If the matrix is sparse then `condest (A)' or `rcond (full (A))' should be used instead.  See also: inv.

 -- Loadable Function: [S, E, TE, M, T, NM] = regexp (STR, PAT)
 -- Loadable Function: [...] = regexp (STR, PAT, OPTS, ...)
     Regular expression string matching.  Matches PAT in STR and returns the position and matching substrings or empty values if there are none.

     The matched pattern PAT can include any of the standard regex operators, including:

    `.'
          Match any character

    `* + ? {}'
          Repetition operators, representing
         `*'
               Match zero or more times

         `+'
               Match one or more times

         `?'
               Match zero or one times

         `{}'
               Match range operator, which is of the form `{N}' to match exactly N times, `{M,}' to match M or more times, `{M,N}' to match between M and N times.

    `[...] [^...]'
          List operators, where for example `[ab]c' matches `ac' and `bc'

    `()'
          Grouping operator

    `|'
          Alternation operator.  Match one of a choice of regular expressions.  The alternatives must be delimited by the grouping operator `()' above

    `^ $'
          Anchoring operator.  `^' matches the start of the string STR and `$' the end

     In addition the following escaped characters have special meaning.  It should be noted that it is recommended to quote PAT in single quotes rather than double quotes, to avoid the escape sequences being interpreted by Octave before being passed to `regexp'.

    `\b'
          Match a word boundary

    `\B'
          Match within a word

    `\w'
          Matches any word character

    `\W'
          Matches any non word character

    `\<'
          Matches the beginning of a word

    `\>'
          Matches the end of a word

    `\s'
          Matches any whitespace character

    `\S'
          Matches any non whitespace character

    `\d'
          Matches any digit

    `\D'
          Matches any non-digit

     The outputs of `regexp' by default are in the order as given below

    S
          The start indices of each of the matching substrings

    E
          The end indices of each matching substring

    TE
          The extents of each of the matched token surrounded by `(...)' in PAT.

    M
          A cell array of the text of each match.

    T
          A cell array of the text of each token matched.

    NM
          A structure containing the text of each matched named token, with the name being used as the fieldname.  A named token is denoted as `(?<name>...)'

     Particular output arguments or the order of the output arguments can be selected by additional OPTS arguments.  These are strings and the correspondence between the output arguments and the optional argument are

    lineanchors
          Match the anchor characters at the beginning and end of the line.

    dotall
          The character `.' matches the newline character.

    dotexceptnewline
          The character `.' matches all but the newline character.

    freespacing
          The pattern can include arbitrary whitespace and comments starting with `#'.

 -- Loadable Function: S = schur (A)
 -- Loadable Function: [U, S] = schur (A, OPT)
     The Schur decomposition is used to compute eigenvalues of a square matrix, and has applications in the solution of algebraic Riccati equations in control (see `are' and `dare').  `schur' always returns `s = u' * a * u' where `u'  is a unitary matrix (`u'* u' is identity) and `s' is upper triangular.  The eigenvalues of `a' (and `s') are the diagonal elements of `s'.  If the matrix `a' is real, then the real Schur decomposition is computed, in which the matrix `u' is orthogonal and `s' is block upper triangular with blocks of size at most `2 x 2' along the diagonal.  The diagonal elements of `s' (or the eigenvalues of the `2 x 2' blocks, when appropriate) are the eigenvalues of `a' and `s'.

     The eigenvalues are optionally ordered along the diagonal according to the value of `opt'.  `opt = "a"' indicates that all eigenvalues with negative real parts should be moved to the leading block of `s' (used in `are'), `opt = "d"' indicates that all eigenvalues with magnitude less than one should be moved to the leading block of `s' (used in `dare'), and `opt = "u"', the default, indicates that no ordering of eigenvalues should occur.  The leading `k' columns of `u' always span the `a'-invariant subspace corresponding to the `k' leading eigenvalues of `s'.

     Create a sparse matrix from the full matrix or row, column, value triplets.  If A is a full matrix, convert it to a sparse matrix representation, removing all zero values in the process.

     Given the integer index vectors I and J, a 1-by-`nnz' vector of real of complex values SV, overall dimensions M and N of the sparse matrix.  The argument `nzmax' is ignored but accepted for compatibility with MATLAB.  If M or N are not specified their values are derived from the maximum index in the vectors I and J as given by `M = max (I)', `N = max (J)'.

     *Note*: if multiple values are specified with the same I, J indices, the corresponding values in S will be added.

     The following are all equivalent:

          s = sparse (i, j, s, m, n)
          s = sparse (i, j, s, m, n, "summation")
          s = sparse (i, j, s, m, n, "sum")

     `sparse(M, N)' is equivalent to `sparse ([], [], [], M, N, 0)'

     If any of SV, I or J are scalars, they are expanded to have a common size.  See also: full.

     Query or set the internal variable that controls whether Octave checks the time stamp on files each time it looks up functions defined in function files.  If the internal variable is set to `"system"', Octave will not automatically recompile function files in subdirectories of `OCTAVE-HOME/lib/VERSION' if they have changed since they were last compiled, but will recompile other function files in the search path if they change.  If set to `"all"', Octave will not recompile any function files unless their definitions are removed with `clear'.  If set to "none", Octave will always check time stamps on files to determine whether functions defined in function files need to recompiled.

 -- Built-in Function: [ERR, MSG] = exec (FILE, ARGS)
     Replace current process with a new process.  Calling `exec' without first calling `fork' will terminate your current Octave process and replace it with the program named by FILE.  For example,

          exec ("ls" "-l")

     will run `ls' and return you to your shell prompt.

     If successful, `exec' does not return.  If `exec' does return, ERR will be nonzero, and MSG will contain a system-dependent error message.

 -- Built-in Function: [IN, OUT, PID] = popen2 (COMMAND, ARGS)
     Start a subprocess with two-way communication.  The name of the process is given by COMMAND, and ARGS is an array of strings containing options for the command.  The file identifiers for the input and output streams of the subprocess are returned in IN and OUT.  If execution of the command is successful, PID contains the process ID of the subprocess.  Otherwise, PID is -1.

     For example,

          [in, out, pid] = popen2 ("sort", "-r");
          fputs (in, "these\nare\nsome\nstrings\n");
          fclose (in);

               -| some
               -| are

     Note that `popen2', unlike `popen', will not "reap" the child process.  If you don't use `waitpid' to check the child's exit status, it will linger until Octave exits.

          You are in the parent process.  The value returned from `fork' is the process id of the child process.  You should probably arrange to wait for any child processes to exit.

    0
          You are in the child process.  You can call `exec' to start another process.  If that fails, you should probably call `exit'.

    < 0
          The call to `fork' failed for some reason.  You must take evasive action.  A system dependent error message will be waiting in MSG.

 -- Loadable Function:  strftime (FMT, TM_STRUCT)
     Format the time structure TM_STRUCT in a flexible way using the format string FMT that contains `%' substitutions similar to those in `printf'.  Except where noted, substituted fields have a fixed size; numeric fields are padded if necessary.  Padding is with zeros by default; for fields that display a single number, padding can be changed or inhibited by following the `%' with one of the modifiers described below.  Unknown field specifiers are copied as normal characters.  All other characters are copied to the output without change.  For example,

          strftime ("%r (%Z) %A %e %B %Y", localtime (time ()))
               => "01:15:06 AM (CST) Monday 17 February 1997"

 -- Built-in Function:  system (STRING, RETURN_OUTPUT, TYPE)
     Execute a shell command specified by STRING.  The second argument is optional.  If TYPE is `"async"', the process is started in the background and the process id of the child process is returned immediately.  Otherwise, the process is started, and Octave waits until it exits.  If the TYPE argument is omitted, a value of `"sync"' is assumed.

     If two input arguments are given (the actual value of RETURN_OUTPUT is irrelevant) and the subprocess is started synchronously, or if SYSTEM is called with one input argument and one or more output arguments, the output from the command is returned.  Otherwise, if the subprocess is executed synchronously, its output is sent to the standard output.  To send the output of a command executed with SYSTEM through the pager, use a command like

          disp (system (cmd, 1));

     or

          printf ("%s\n", system (cmd, 1));

     The `system' function can return two values.  The first is the exit status of the command and the second is any output from the command that was written to the standard output stream.  For example,

          [status, output] = system ("echo foo; exit 2");

     will set the variable `output' to the string `foo', and the variable `status' to the integer `2'.

 -- Built-in Function:  atexit (FCN)
 -- Built-in Function:  atexit (FCN, FLAG)
     Register a function to be called when Octave exits.  For example,

          function last_words ()
            disp ("Bye bye");
          endfunction
          atexit ("last_words");

     will print the message "Bye bye" when Octave exits.

     The additional argument FLAG will register or unregister FCN from the list of functions to be called when Octave exits.  If FLAG is true, the function is registered, and if FLAG is false, it is unregistered.  For example, after registering the function `last_words' above,

          atexit ("last_words", false);

     will remove the function from the list and Octave will not call `last_words' when it exits.

     Note that `atexit' only removes the first occurrence of a function from the list, so if a function was placed in the list multiple times with `atexit', it must also be removed from the list multiple times.

     An example of the use of typecast on a little-endian machine is

          X = uint16 ([1, 65535]);
          typecast (X, 'uint8')

     assigns the value of the alert character (control-g, ASCII code 7) to the string variable `bell'.  If this string is printed, the system will ring the terminal bell (if it is possible).  This is normally the desired outcome.  However, sometimes it is useful to be able to print the original representation of the string, with the special characters replaced by their escape sequences.  For example,

          octave:13> undo_string_escapes (bell)
          ans = \a

     replaces the unprintable alert character with its printable representation.

 -- Command: clear [options] pattern ...
     Delete the names matching the given patterns from the symbol table.  The pattern may contain the following special characters:

    `?'
          Match any single character.

    `*'
          Match zero or more characters.

    `[ LIST ]'
          Match the list of characters specified by LIST.  If the first character is `!' or `^', match all characters except those specified by LIST.  For example, the pattern `[a-zA-Z]' will match all lower and upper case alphabetic characters.

     For example, the command

          clear foo b*r

     clears the name `foo' and all names that begin with the letter `b' and end with the letter `r'.

     If `clear' is called without any arguments, all user-defined variables (local and global) are cleared from the symbol table.  If `clear' is called with at least one argument, only the visible names matching the arguments are cleared.  For example, suppose you have defined a function `foo', and then hidden it by performing the assignment `foo = 2'.  Executing the command `clear foo' once will clear the variable definition and restore the definition of `foo' as a function.  Executing `clear foo' a second time will clear the function definition.

     The following options are available in both long and short form
    `-all, -a'
          Clears all local and global user-defined variables and all functions from the symbol table.

    `-exclusive, -x'
          Clears the variables that don't match the following pattern.

    `-functions, -f'
          Clears the function names and the built-in symbols names.

    `-global, -g'
          Clears the global symbol names.

    `-variables, -v'
          Clears the local variable names.

    `-classes, -c'
          Clears the class structure table and clears all objects.

    `-regexp, -r'
          The arguments are treated as regular expressions as any variables that match will be cleared.
     With the exception of `exclusive', all long options can be used without the dash as well.

 -- Built-in Function: VAL = whos_line_format ()
 -- Built-in Function: OLD_VAL = whos_line_format (NEW_VAL)
     Query or set the format string used by the command `whos'.

     A full format string is:

          %[modifier]<command>[:width[:left-min[:balance]]];

     The following command sequences are available:

    `%a'
          Prints attributes of variables (g=global, p=persistent, f=formal parameter, a=automatic variable).

    `%b'
          Prints number of bytes occupied by variables.

    `%c'
          Prints class names of variables.

    `%e'
          Prints elements held by variables.

    `%n'
          Prints variable names.

    `%s'
          Prints dimensions of variables.

    `%t'
          Prints type names of variables.

     Every command may also have an alignment modifier:

    `l'
          Left alignment.

    `r'
          Right alignment (default).

    `c'
          Column-aligned (only applicable to command %s).

     The `width' parameter is a positive integer specifying the minimum number of columns used for printing.  No maximum is needed as the field will auto-expand as required.

     The parameters `left-min' and `balance' are only available when the column-aligned modifier is used with the command `%s'.  `balance' specifies the column number within the field width which will be aligned between entries.  Numbering starts from 0 which indicates the leftmost column.  `left-min' specifies the minimum field width to the left of the specified balance column.

     The default format is `"  %a:4; %ln:6; %cs:16:6:1;  %rb:12;  %lc:-1;\n"'.  See also: whos.

 -- Function File:  accumarray (SUBS, VALS, SZ, FUNC, FILLVAL, ISSPARSE)
 -- Function File:  accumarray (CSUBS, VALS, ...)
     Create an array by accumulating the elements of a vector into the positions defined by their subscripts.  The subscripts are defined by the rows of the matrix SUBS and the values by VALS.  Each row of SUBS corresponds to one of the values in VALS.

     The size of the matrix will be determined by the subscripts themselves.  However, if SZ is defined it determines the matrix size.  The length of SZ must correspond to the number of columns in SUBS.

     The default action of `accumarray' is to sum the elements with the same subscripts.  This behavior can be modified by defining the FUNC function.  This should be a function or function handle that accepts a column vector and returns a scalar.  The result of the function should not depend on the order of the subscripts.

     The elements of the returned array that have no subscripts associated with them are set to zero.  Defining FILLVAL to some other value allows these values to be defined.

     By default `accumarray' returns a full matrix.  If ISSPARSE is logically true, then a sparse matrix is returned instead.

     An example of the use of `accumarray' is:

          accumarray ([1,1,1;2,1,2;2,3,2;2,1,2;2,3,2], 101:105)
          => ans(:,:,1) = [101, 0, 0; 0, 0, 0]
             ans(:,:,2) = [0, 0, 0; 206, 0, 208]

 -- Function File: [X, Y, ...] = arrayfun (FUNC, A, ...)
 -- Function File:  arrayfun (..., "UniformOutput", VAL)
 -- Function File:  arrayfun (..., "ErrorHandler", ERRFUNC)
     Execute a function on each element of an array.  This is useful for functions that do not accept array arguments.  If the function does accept array arguments it is better to call the function directly.

     The first input argument FUNC can be a string, a function handle, an inline function or an anonymous function.  The input argument A can be a logic array, a numeric array, a string array, a structure array or a cell array.  By a call of the function `arrayfun' all elements of A are passed on to the named function FUNC individually.

     The named function can also take more than two input arguments, with the input arguments given as third input argument B, fourth input argument C, ...  If given more than one array input argument then all input arguments must have the same sizes, for example

          arrayfun (@atan2, [1, 0], [0, 1])
          => ans = [1.5708   0.0000]

     If the parameter VAL after a further string input argument "UniformOutput" is set `true' (the default), then the named function FUNC must return a single element which then will be concatenated into the return value and is of type matrix.  Otherwise, if that parameter is set to `false', then the outputs are concatenated in a cell array.  For example

          arrayfun (@(x,y) x:y, "abc", "def", "UniformOutput", false)
          => ans =
          {
            [1,1] = abcd
            [1,2] = bcde
            [1,3] = cdef
          }

     If more than one output arguments are given then the named function must return the number of return values that also are expected, for example

          [A, B, C] = arrayfun (@find, [10; 0], "UniformOutput", false)
          =>
          A =
          {
            [1,1] =  1
            [2,1] = [](0x0)
          }
          B =
          {
            [1,1] =  1
            [2,1] = [](0x0)
          }
          C =
          {
            [1,1] =  10
            [2,1] = [](0x0)
          }

     If the parameter ERRFUNC after a further string input argument "ErrorHandler" is another string, a function handle, an inline function or an anonymous function, then ERRFUNC defines a function to call in the case that FUNC generates an error.  The definition of the function must be of the form

          function [...] = errfunc (S, ...)

     where there is an additional input argument to ERRFUNC relative to FUNC, given by S.  This is a structure with the elements "identifier", "message" and "index", giving respectively the error identifier, the error message and the index of the array elements that caused the error.  The size of the output argument of ERRFUNC must have the same size as the output argument of FUNC, otherwise a real error is thrown.  For example

          function y = ferr (s, x), y = "MyString"; endfunction
          arrayfun (@str2num, [1234], \
                    "UniformOutput", false, "ErrorHandler", @ferr)
          => ans =
          {
           [1,1] = MyString
          }

     Determine if all input arguments are either scalar or of common size.  If so, ERR is zero, and YI is a matrix of the common size with all entries equal to XI if this is a scalar or XI otherwise.  If the inputs cannot be brought to a common size, errorcode is 1, and YI is XI.  For example,

          [errorcode, a, b] = common_size ([1 2; 3 4], 5)
               => errorcode = 0
               => a = [ 1, 2; 3, 4 ]
               => b = [ 5, 5; 5, 5 ]

     This is useful for implementing functions where arguments can either be scalars or of common size.

     Sort the numbers Z into complex conjugate pairs ordered by increasing real part.  Place the negative imaginary complex number first within each pair.  Place all the real numbers (those with `abs (imag (Z) / Z) < TOL)') after the complex pairs.

     If TOL is unspecified the default value is 100*`eps'.

     By default the complex pairs are sorted along the first non-singleton dimension of Z.  If DIM is specified, then the complex pairs are sorted along this dimension.

     Signal an error if some complex numbers could not be paired.  Signal an error if all complex numbers are not exact conjugates (to within TOL).  Note that there is no defined order for pairs with identical real parts but differing imaginary parts.

     Calculate the discrete Laplace operator.  For a 2-dimensional matrix M this is defined as

                1    / d^2            d^2         \

                4    \ dx^2           dy^2        /

     For N-dimensional arrays the sum in parentheses is expanded to include second derivatives over the additional higher dimensions.

     The spacing between evaluation points may be defined by H, which is a scalar defining the equidistant spacing in all dimensions.  Alternatively, the spacing in each dimension may be defined separately by DX, DY, etc.  A scalar spacing argument defines equidistant spacing, whereas a vector argument can be used to specify variable spacing.  The length of the spacing vectors must match the respective dimension of M.  The default spacing value is 1.

     At least 3 data points are needed for each dimension.  Boundary points are calculated from the linear extrapolation of interior points.

 -- Function File:  diff (X, K, DIM)
     If X is a vector of length N, `diff (X)' is the vector of first differences X(2) - X(1), ..., X(n) - X(n-1).

     If X is a matrix, `diff (X)' is the matrix of column differences along the first non-singleton dimension.

     The second argument is optional.  If supplied, `diff (X, K)', where K is a non-negative integer, returns the K-th differences.  It is possible that K is larger than then first non-singleton dimension of the matrix.  In this case, `diff' continues to take the differences along the next non-singleton dimension.

     The dimension along which to take the difference can be explicitly stated with the optional variable DIM.  In this case the K-th order differences are calculated along this dimension.  In the case where K exceeds `size (X, DIM)' then an empty matrix is returned.

 -- Function File: VARNAME = genvarname (STR)
 -- Function File: VARNAME = genvarname (STR, EXCLUSIONS)
     Create unique variable(s) from STR.  If EXCLUSIONS is given, then the variable(s) will be unique to each other and to EXCLUSIONS (EXCLUSIONS may be either a string or a cellstr).

     If STR is a cellstr, then a unique variable is created for each cell in STR.

          x = 3.141;
          genvarname ("x", who ())
          => x1

     If WANTED is a cell array, genvarname will make sure the returned strings are distinct:

          genvarname ({"foo", "foo"})
          =>
          {
            [1,1] = foo
            [1,2] = foo1
          }

     Note that the result is a char array/cell array of strings, not the variables themselves.  To define a variable, `eval()' can be used.  The following trivial example sets `x' to `42'.

          name = genvarname ("x");
          eval([name " = 42"]);
          => x =  42

     Also, this can be useful for creating unique struct field names.

          x = struct ();
          for i = 1:3
            x.(genvarname ("a", fieldnames (x))) = i;
          endfor
          =>
          x =
          {
            a =  1
            a1 =  2
            a2 =  3
          }

     Since variable names may only contain letters, digits and underscores, genvarname replaces any sequence of disallowed characters with an underscore.  Also, variables may not begin with a digit; in this case an underscore is added before the variable name.

     Variable names beginning and ending with two underscores "__" are valid but they are used internally by octave and should generally be avoided, therefore genvarname will not generate such names.

     genvarname will also make sure that returned names do not clash with keywords such as "for" and "if".  A number will be appended if necessary.  Note, however, that this does *not* include function names, such as "sin".  Such names should be included in AVOID if necessary.  See also: isvarname, exist, tmpnam, eval.

     Calculate the gradient of sampled data or a function.  If M is a vector, calculate the one-dimensional gradient of M.  If M is a matrix the gradient is calculated for each dimension.

     `[DX, DY] = gradient (M)' calculates the one dimensional gradient for X and Y direction if M is a matrix.  Additional return arguments can be use for multi-dimensional matrices.

     A constant spacing between two points can be provided by the S parameter.  If S is a scalar, it is assumed to be the spacing for all dimensions.  Otherwise, separate values of the spacing can be supplied by the X, ... arguments.  Scalar values specify an equidistant spacing.  Vector values for the X, ... arguments specify the coordinate for that dimension.  The length must match their respective dimension of M.

     At boundary points a linear extrapolation is applied.  Interior points are calculated with the first approximation of the numerical gradient

          y'(i) = 1/(x(i+1)-x(i-1)) * (y(i-1)-y(i+1)).

     If the first argument F is a function handle, the gradient of the function at the points in X0 is approximated using central difference.  For example, `gradient (@cos, 0)' approximates the gradient of the cosine function in the point x0 = 0.  As with sampled data, the spacing values between the points from which the gradient is estimated can be set via the S or DX, DY, ... arguments.  By default a spacing of 1 is used.

 -- Function File:  idivide (X, Y, OP)
     Integer division with different round rules.  The standard behavior of the an integer division such as `A ./ B' is to round the result to the nearest integer.  This is not always the desired behavior and `idivide' permits integer element-by-element division to be performed with different treatment for the fractional part of the division as determined by the OP flag.  OP is a string with one of the values:

    "fix"
          Calculate `A ./ B' with the fractional part rounded towards zero.

    "round"
          Calculate `A ./ B' with the fractional part rounded towards the nearest integer.

    "floor"
          Calculate `A ./ B' with the fractional part rounded downwards.

    "ceil"
          Calculate `A ./ B' with the fractional part rounded upwards.

     If OP is not given it is assumed that it is `"fix"'.  An example demonstrating these rounding rules is

     One-dimensional interpolation.  Interpolate Y, defined at the points X, at the points XI.  The sample points X must be strictly monotonic.  If Y is an array, treat the columns of Y separately.

     Method is one of:

    'nearest'
          Return the nearest neighbor.

    'linear'
          Linear interpolation from nearest neighbors

    'pchip'
          Piece-wise cubic hermite interpolating polynomial

    'cubic'
          Cubic interpolation from four nearest neighbors

    'spline'
          Cubic spline interpolation-smooth first and second derivatives throughout the curve

     Appending '*' to the start of the above method forces `interp1' to assume that X is uniformly spaced, and only `X (1)' and `X (2)' are referenced.  This is usually faster, and is never slower.  The default method is 'linear'.

     If EXTRAP is the string 'extrap', then extrapolate values beyond the endpoints.  If EXTRAP is a number, replace values beyond the endpoints with that number.  If EXTRAP is missing, assume NA.

     If the string argument 'pp' is specified, then XI should not be supplied and `interp1' returns the piece-wise polynomial that can later be used with `ppval' to evaluate the interpolation.  There is an equivalence, such that `ppval (interp1 (X, Y, METHOD, 'pp'), XI) == interp1 (X, Y, XI, METHOD, 'extrap')'.

     An example of the use of `interp1' is

          xf = [0:0.05:10];
          yf = sin (2*pi*xf/5);

 -- Function File: YI = interp1q (X, Y, XI)
     One-dimensional linear interpolation without error checking.  Interpolates Y, defined at the points X, at the points XI.  The sample points X must be a strictly monotonically increasing column vector.  If Y is an array, treat the columns of Y separately.  If Y is a vector, it must be a column vector of the same length as X.

     Values of XI beyond the endpoints of the interpolation result in NA being returned.

     Note that the error checking is only a significant portion of the execution time of this `interp1' if the size of the input arguments is relatively small.  Therefore, the benefit of using `interp1q' is relatively small.  See also: interp1.

     Two-dimensional interpolation.  X, Y and Z describe a surface function.  If X and Y are vectors their length must correspondent to the size of Z.  X and Y must be monotonic.  If they are matrices they must have the `meshgrid' format.

     Perform 3-dimensional interpolation.  Each element of the 3-dimensional array V represents a value at a location given by the parameters X, Y, and Z.  The parameters X, X, and Z are either 3-dimensional arrays of the same size as the array V in the 'meshgrid' format or vectors.  The parameters XI, etc.  respect a similar format to X, etc., and they represent the points at which the array VI is interpolated.

     If X, Y, Z are omitted, they are assumed to be `x = 1 : size (V, 2)', `y = 1 : size (V, 1)' and `z = 1 : size (V, 3)'.  If M is specified, then the interpolation adds a point half way between each of the interpolation points.  This process is performed M times.  If only V is specified, then M is assumed to be `1'.

               => "1.234+27.3i"

     The `num2str' function is not very flexible.  For better control over the results, use `sprintf' (*note Formatted Output::).  Note that for complex X, the format string may only contain one output conversion specification and nothing else.  Otherwise, you will get unpredictable results.

 -- Function File:  quadgk (F, A, B, ABSTOL, TRACE)
 -- Function File:  quadgk (F, A, B, PROP, VAL, ...)
 -- Function File: [Q, ERR] = quadgk (...)
     Numerically evaluate integral using adaptive Gauss-Konrod quadrature.  The formulation is based on a proposal by L.F. Shampine, `"Vectorized adaptive quadrature in MATLAB", Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics, pp131-140, Vol 211, Issue 2, Feb 2008' where all function evaluations at an iteration are calculated with a single call to F.  Therefore the function F must be of the form `F (X)' and accept vector values of X and return a vector of the same length representing the function evaluations at the given values of X.  The function F can be defined in terms of a function handle, inline function or string.

     The bounds of the quadrature `[A, B]' can be finite or infinite and contain weak end singularities.  Variable transformation will be used to treat infinite intervals and weaken the singularities.  For example

          quadgk(@(x) 1 ./ (sqrt (x) .* (x + 1)), 0, Inf)

     Note that the formulation of the integrand uses the element-by-element operator `./' and all user functions to `quadgk' should do the same.

     The absolute tolerance can be passed as a fourth argument in a manner compatible with `quadv'.  Equally the user can request that information on the convergence can be printed is the fifth argument is logically true.

     Alternatively, certain properties of `quadgk' can be passed as pairs `PROP, VAL'.  Valid properties are

    `AbsTol'
          Defines the absolute error tolerance for the quadrature.  The default absolute tolerance is 1e-10.

    `RelTol'
          Defines the relative error tolerance for the quadrature.  The default relative tolerance is 1e-5.

    `MaxIntervalCount'
          `quadgk' initially subdivides the interval on which to perform the quadrature into 10 intervals.  Sub-intervals that have an unacceptable error are sub-divided and re-evaluated.  If the number of sub-intervals exceeds at any point 650 sub-intervals then a poor convergence is signaled and the current estimate of the integral is returned.  The property 'MaxIntervalCount' can be used to alter the number of sub-intervals that can exist before exiting.

    `WayPoints'
          If there exists discontinuities in the first derivative of the function to integrate, then these can be flagged with the `"WayPoints"' property.  This forces the ends of a sub-interval to fall on the breakpoints of the function and can result in significantly improved estimation of the error in the integral, faster computation or both.  For example,

               quadgk (@(x) abs (1 - x .^ 2), 0, 2, 'Waypoints', 1)

          signals the breakpoint in the integrand at `X = 1'.

    `Trace'
          If logically true, then `quadgk' prints information on the convergence of the quadrature at each iteration.

     If any of A, B or WAYPOINTS is complex, then the quadrature is treated as a contour integral along a piecewise continuous path defined by the above.  In this case the integral is assumed to have no edge singularities.  For example

          quadgk (@(z) log (z), 1+1i, 1+1i, "WayPoints",
                  [1-1i, -1,-1i, -1+1i])

     integrates `log (z)' along the square defined by `[1+1i,  1-1i, -1-1i, -1+1i]'

     If two output arguments are requested, then ERR returns the approximate bounds on the error in the integral `abs (Q - I)', where I is the exact value of the integral.

     Numerically evaluate integral using adaptive Lobatto rule.  `quadl (F, A, B)' approximates the integral of `F(X)' to machine precision.  F is either a function handle, inline function or string containing the name of the function to evaluate.  The function F must return a vector of output values if given a vector of input values.

     If defined, TOL defines the relative tolerance to which to which to integrate `F(X)'.  While if TRACE is defined, displays the left end point of the current interval, the interval length, and the partial integral.

     Additional arguments P1, etc., are passed directly to F.  To use default values for TOL and TRACE, one may pass empty matrices.

     Numerically evaluate integral using adaptive Simpson's rule.  `quadv (F, A, B)' approximates the integral of `F(X)' to the default absolute tolerance of `1e-6'.  F is either a function handle, inline function or string containing the name of the function to evaluate.  The function F must accept a string, and can return a vector representing the approximation to N different sub-functions.

     If defined, TOL defines the absolute tolerance to which to which to integrate each sub-interval of `F(X)'.  While if TRACE is defined, displays the left end point of the current interval, the interval length, and the partial integral.

     Method of a class to manipulate an object prior to saving it to a file.  The function `saveobj' is called when the object A is saved using the `save' function.  An example of the use of `saveobj' might be to remove fields of the object that don't make sense to be saved or it might be used to ensure that certain fields of the object are initialized before the object is saved.  For example

 -- Function File:  structfun (..., "UniformOutput", VAL)
     Evaluate the function named NAME on the fields of the structure S.  The fields of S are passed to the function FUNC individually.

     `structfun' accepts an arbitrary function FUNC in the form of an inline function, function handle, or the name of a function (in a character string).  In the case of a character string argument, the function must accept a single argument named X, and it must return a string value.  If the function returns more than one argument, they are returned as separate output variables.

     If the parameter "UniformOutput" is set to true (the default), then the function must return a single element which will be concatenated into the return value.  If "UniformOutput" is false, the outputs placed in a structure with the same fieldnames as the input structure.

          s.name1 = "John Smith";
          s.name2 = "Jill Jones";
          structfun (@(x) regexp (x, '(\w+)$', "matches"){1}, s,
                     "UniformOutput", false)

     Given the parameter "ErrorHandler", then ERRFUNC defines a function to call in case FUNC generates an error.  The form of the function is

          function [...] = errfunc (SE, ...)

     where there is an additional input argument to ERRFUNC relative to FUNC, given by SE.  This is a structure with the elements "identifier", "message" and "index", giving respectively the error identifier, the error message, and the index into the input arguments of the element that caused the error.

     Convert an object to an index vector.  When A is a class object defined with a class constructor, then `subsindex' is the overloading method that allows the conversion of this class object to a valid indexing vector.  It is important to note that `subsindex' must return a zero-based real integer vector of the class "double".  For example, if the class constructor

          function b = myclass (a)
           b = myclass (struct ("a", a), "myclass");
          endfunction

 -- Function File: T = delaunayn (P, OPT)
     Form the Delaunay triangulation for a set of points.  The Delaunay triangulation is a tessellation of the convex hull of the points such that no n-sphere defined by the n-triangles contains any other points from the set.  The input matrix P of size `[n, dim]' contains N points in a space of dimension dim.  The return matrix T has the size `[m, dim+1]'.  It contains for each row a set of indices to the points, which describes a simplex of dimension dim.  For example, a 2d simplex is a triangle and 3d simplex is a tetrahedron.

     Extra options for the underlying Qhull command can be specified by the second argument.  This argument is a cell array of strings.  The default options depend on the dimension of the input:

        * 2D and 3D: OPT = `{"Qt", "Qbb", "Qc"}'

        * 4D and higher: OPT = `{"Qt", "Qbb", "Qc", "Qz"}'

     If OPT is [], then the default arguments are used.  If OPT is `{""}', then none of the default arguments are used by Qhull.  See the Qhull documentation for the available options.

     All options can also be specified as single string, for example `"Qt Qbb Qc Qz"'.

 -- Command: lookfor STR
 -- Command: lookfor -all STR
 -- Function: [FUNC, HELPSTRING] = lookfor (STR)
 -- Function: [FUNC, HELPSTRING] = lookfor ('-all', STR)
     Search for the string STR in all functions found in the current function search path.  By default, `lookfor' searches for STR in the first sentence of the help string of each function found.  The entire help text of each function can be searched if the '-all' argument is supplied.  All searches are case insensitive.

     Called with no output arguments, `lookfor' prints the list of matching functions to the terminal.  Otherwise, the output arguments FUNC and HELPSTRING define the matching functions and the first sentence of each of their help strings.

     The ability of `lookfor' to correctly identify the first sentence of the help text is dependent on the format of the function's help.  All Octave core functions are correctly formatted, but the same can not be guaranteed for external packages and user-supplied functions.  Therefore, the use of the '-all' argument may be necessary to find related functions that are not a part of Octave.  See also: help, doc, which.

     Display a matrix as a color image.  The elements of X are indices into the current colormap, and the colormap will be scaled so that the extremes of X are mapped to the extremes of the colormap.

     It first tries to use `gnuplot', then `display' from `ImageMagick', then `xv', and then `xloadimage'.  The actual program used can be changed using the `image_viewer' function.

     The axis values corresponding to the matrix elements are specified in X and Y.  If you're not using gnuplot 4.2 or later, these variables are ignored.  See also: imshow, imagesc, colormap, image_viewer.

 -- Function File: [FCN, DEFAULT_ZOOM] = image_viewer (FCN, DEFAULT_ZOOM)
     Change the program or function used for viewing images and return the previous values.

     When the `image' or `imshow' function is called it will launch an external program to display the image.  The default behavior is to use gnuplot if the installed version supports image viewing, and otherwise try the programs `display', `xv', and `xloadimage'.  Using this function it is possible to change that behavior.

     When called with one input argument images will be displayed by saving the image to a file and the system command COMMAND will be called to view the image.  The COMMAND must be a string containing `%s' and possibly `%f'.  The `%s' will be replaced by the filename of the image, and the `%f' will (if present) be replaced by the zoom factor given to the `image' function.  For example,
          image_viewer ("eog %s");
     changes the image viewer to the `eog' program.

     With two input arguments, images will be displayed by calling the function FUNCTION_HANDLE.  For example,
          image_viewer (data, @my_image_viewer);
     sets the image viewer function to `my_image_viewer'.  The image viewer function is called with
          my_image_viewer (X, Y, IM, ZOOM, DATA)
     where X and Y are the axis of the image, IM is the image variable, and DATA is extra user-supplied data to be passed to the viewer function.

     With three input arguments it is possible to change the zooming.  Some programs (like `xloadimage') require the zoom factor to be between 0 and 100, and not 0 and 1 like Octave assumes.  This is solved by setting the third argument to 100.

     Read images from various file formats.

     The size and numeric class of the output depends on the format of the image.  A color image is returned as an MxNx3 matrix.  Grey-level and black-and-white images are of size MxN.  The color depth of the image determines the numeric class of the output: "uint8" or "uint16" for grey and color, and "logical" for black and white.

 -- Function File:  cond (A,P)
     Compute the P-norm condition number of a matrix.  `cond (A)' is defined as `norm (A, P) * norm (inv (A), P)'.  By default `P=2' is used which implies a (relatively slow) singular value decomposition.  Other possible selections are `P= 1, Inf, inf, 'Inf', 'fro'' which are generally faster.

 -- Function File: [EST, V] = condest (A, SOLVE, SOLVE_T, T)
 -- Function File: [EST, V] = condest (APPLY, APPLY_T, SOLVE, SOLVE_T, N, T)
     Estimate the 1-norm condition number of a matrix A using T test vectors using a randomized 1-norm estimator.  If T exceeds 5, then only 5 test vectors are used.

     If the matrix is not explicit, e.g., when estimating the condition number of A given an LU factorization, `condest' uses the following functions:

    APPLY
          `A*x' for a matrix `x' of size N by T.

    APPLY_T
          `A'*x' for a matrix `x' of size N by T.

    SOLVE
          `A \ b' for a matrix `b' of size N by T.

    SOLVE_T
          `A' \ b' for a matrix `b' of size N by T.

     The implicit version requires an explicit dimension N.

     `condest' uses a randomized algorithm to approximate the 1-norms.

     `condest' returns the 1-norm condition estimate EST and a vector V satisfying `norm (A*v, 1) == norm (A, 1) * norm (V, 1) / EST'.  When EST is large, V is an approximate null vector.

     The Taylor series is _not_ the way to compute the matrix exponential; see Moler and Van Loan, `Nineteen Dubious Ways to Compute the Exponential of a Matrix', SIAM Review, 1978.  This routine uses Ward's diagonal Pade' approximation method with three step preconditioning (SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis, 1977).

     Using Householder reflections to guard against loss of orthogonality.

     If V is a vector, then H contains the Hessenberg matrix such that `a*u == u*h+rk*ek'', in which `rk = a*u(:,k)-u*h(:,k)', and `ek'' is the vector `[0, 0, ..., 1]' of length `k'.  Otherwise, H is meaningless.

     If V is a vector and K is greater than `length(A)-1', then H contains the Hessenberg matrix such that `a*u == u*h'.

     The value of NU is the dimension of the span of the krylov subspace (based on EPS1).

     If B is a vector and K is greater than M-1, then H contains the Hessenberg decomposition of A.

     The optional parameter EPS1 is the threshold for zero.  The default value is 1e-12.

     If the optional parameter PFLG is nonzero, row pivoting is used to improve numerical behavior.  The default value is 0.

     Apply Higham and Tisseur's randomized block 1-norm estimator to matrix A using T test vectors.  If T exceeds 5, then only 5 test vectors are used.

     If the matrix is not explicit, e.g., when estimating the norm of `inv (A)' given an LU factorization, `onenormest' applies A and its conjugate transpose through a pair of functions APPLY and APPLY_T, respectively, to a dense matrix of size N by T.  The implicit version requires an explicit dimension N.

     Returns the norm estimate EST, two vectors V and W related by norm `(W, 1) = EST * norm (V, 1)', and the number of iterations ITER.  The number of iterations is limited to 10 and is at least 2.

 -- Function File:  compare_versions (V1, V2, OPERATOR)
     Compares to version strings using the given OPERATOR.

     This function assumes that versions V1 and V2 are arbitrarily long strings made of numeric and period characters possibly followed by an arbitrary string (e.g., "1.2.3", "0.3", "0.1.2+", or "1.2.3.4-test1").

     The version is first split into the numeric and the character parts then the parts are padded to be the same length (i.e., "1.1" would be padded to be like "1.1.0" when being compared with "1.1.1", and separately, the character parts of the strings are padded with nulls).

     The operator can be any logical operator from the set

        * "==" equal

        * "<" less than

        * "<=" less than or equal to

        * ">" greater than

        * ">=" greater than or equal to

        * "!=" not equal

        * "~=" not equal

     Note that version "1.1-test2" would compare as greater than "1.1-test10".  Also, since the numeric part is compared first, "a" compares less than "1a" because the second string starts with a numeric part even though double("a") is greater than double("1").

 -- Command: edit NAME
 -- Command: edit FIELD VALUE
 -- Command: VALUE = edit get FIELD
     Edit the named function, or change editor settings.

     If `edit' is called with the name of a file or function as its argument it will be opened in a text editor.

        * If the function NAME is available in a file on your path and that file is modifiable, then it will be edited in place.  If it is a system function, then it will first be copied to the directory `HOME' (see further down) and then edited.  If no file is found, then the m-file variant, ending with ".m", will be considered.  If still no file is found, then variants with a leading "@" and then with both a leading "@" and trailing ".m" will be considered.

        * If NAME is the name of a function defined in the interpreter but not in an m-file, then an m-file will be created in `HOME' to contain that function along with its current definition.

        * If `name.cc' is specified, then it will search for `name.cc' in the path and try to modify it, otherwise it will create a new `.cc' file in `HOME'.  If NAME happens to be an m-file or interpreter defined function, then the text of that function will be inserted into the .cc file as a comment.

        * If NAME.EXT is on your path then it will be edited, otherwise the editor will be started with `HOME/name.ext' as the filename.  If `name.ext' is not modifiable, it will be copied to `HOME' before editing.

          *WARNING!* You may need to clear name before the new definition is available.  If you are editing a .cc file, you will need to mkoctfile `name.cc' before the definition will be available.

     If `edit' is called with FIELD and VALUE variables, the value of the control field FIELD will be VALUE.  If an output argument is requested and the first argument is `get' then `edit' will return the value of the control field FIELD.  If the control field does not exist, edit will return a structure containing all fields and values.  Thus, `edit get all' returns a complete control structure.  The following control fields are used:

    `editor'
          This is the editor to use to modify the functions.  By default it uses Octave's `EDITOR' built-in function, which comes from `getenv("EDITOR")' and defaults to `emacs'.  Use `%s' In place of the function name.  For example,
         `[EDITOR, " %s"]'
               Use the editor which Octave uses for `bug_report'.

         `"xedit %s &"'
               pop up simple X11 editor in a separate window

         `"gnudoit -q \"(find-file \\\"%s\\\")\""'
               Send it to current Emacs; must have `(gnuserv-start)' in `.emacs'.

          See also field 'mode', which controls how the editor is run by Octave.

          On Cygwin, you will need to convert the Cygwin path to a Windows path if you are using a native Windows editor.  For example
               '"C:/Program Files/Good Editor/Editor.exe" "$(cygpath -wa %s)"'

    `home'
          This is the location of user local m-files.  Be be sure it is in your path.  The default is `~/octave'.

    `author'
          This is the name to put after the "## Author:" field of new functions.  By default it guesses from the `gecos' field of password database.

    `email'
          This is the e-mail address to list after the name in the author field.  By default it guesses `<$LOGNAME@$HOSTNAME>', and if `$HOSTNAME' is not defined it uses `uname -n'.  You probably want to override this.  Be sure to use `<user@host>' as your format.

    `license'

         `gpl'
               GNU General Public License (default).

         `bsd'
               BSD-style license without advertising clause.

         `pd'
               Public domain.

         `"text"'
               Your own default copyright and license.

          Unless you specify `pd', edit will prepend the copyright statement with "Copyright (C) yyyy Function Author".

    `mode'
          This value determines whether the editor should be started in async mode (editor is started in the background and Octave continues) or sync mode (Octave waits until the editor exits).  Set it to "async" to start the editor in async mode.  The default is "sync" (see also "system").

    `editinplace'
          Determines whether files should be edited in place, without regard to whether they are modifiable or not.  The default is `false'.

 -- Function File:  fminunc (FCN, X0, OPTIONS)
 -- Function File: [X, FVEC, INFO, OUTPUT, FJAC] = fminunc (FCN, ...)
     Solve a unconstrained optimization problem defined by the function FCN.  FCN should accepts a vector (array) defining the unknown variables, and return the objective function value, optionally with gradient.  In other words, this function attempts to determine a vector X such that `FCN (X)' is a local minimum.  X0 determines a starting guess. The shape of X0 is preserved in all calls to FCN, but otherwise it is treated as a column vector.  OPTIONS is a structure specifying additional options.  Currently, `fminunc' recognizes these options: `"FunValCheck"', `"OutputFcn"', `"TolX"', `"TolFun"', `"MaxIter"', `"MaxFunEvals"', `"GradObj"', `"FinDiffType"'.

     If `"GradObj"' is `"on"', it specifies that FCN, called with 2 output arguments, also returns the Jacobian matrix of right-hand sides at the requested point.  `"TolX"' specifies the termination tolerance in the unknown variables, while `"TolFun"' is a tolerance for equations. Default is `1e-7' for both `"TolX"' and `"TolFun"'.

 -- Function File: [X, FVEC, INFO, OUTPUT, FJAC] = fsolve (FCN, ...)
     Solve a system of nonlinear equations defined by the function FCN.  FCN should accepts a vector (array) defining the unknown variables, and return a vector of left-hand sides of the equations.  Right-hand sides are defined to be zeros.  In other words, this function attempts to determine a vector X such that `FCN (X)' gives (approximately) all zeros.  X0 determines a starting guess.  The shape of X0 is preserved in all calls to FCN, but otherwise it is treated as a column vector.  OPTIONS is a structure specifying additional options.  Currently, `fsolve' recognizes these options: `"FunValCheck"', `"OutputFcn"', `"TolX"', `"TolFun"', `"MaxIter"', `"MaxFunEvals"', `"Jacobian"', `"Updating"' and `"ComplexEqn"'.

     If `"Jacobian"' is `"on"', it specifies that FCN, called with 2 output arguments, also returns the Jacobian matrix of right-hand sides at the requested point.  `"TolX"' specifies the termination tolerance in the unknown variables, while `"TolFun"' is a tolerance for equations.  Default is `1e-7' for both `"TolX"' and `"TolFun"'.  If `"Updating"' is "on", the function will attempt to use Broyden updates to update the Jacobian, in order to reduce the amount of jacobian calculations.  If your user function always calculates the Jacobian (regardless of number of output arguments), this option provides no advantage and should be set to false.

     `"ComplexEqn"' is `"on"', `fsolve' will attempt to solve complex equations in complex variables, assuming that the equations possess a complex derivative (i.e., are holomorphic).  If this is not what you want, should unpack the real and imaginary parts of the system to get a real system.

     For description of the other options, see `optimset'.

     On return, FVAL contains the value of the function FCN evaluated at X, and INFO may be one of the following values:

    1
          Converged to a solution point.  Relative residual error is less than specified by TolFun.

    2
          Last relative step size was less that TolX.

    3
          Last relative decrease in residual was less than TolF.

    0
          Iteration limit exceeded.

    -3
          The trust region radius became excessively small.

     Note: If you only have a single nonlinear equation of one variable, using `fzero' is usually a much better idea.  See also: fzero, optimset.

     Note about user-supplied jacobians: As an inherent property of the algorithm, jacobian is always requested for a solution vector whose residual vector is already known, and it is the last accepted successful step.  Often this will be one of the last two calls, but not always.  If the savings by reusing intermediate results from residual calculation in jacobian calculation are significant, the best strategy is to employ OutputFcn: After a vector is evaluated for residuals, if OutputFcn is called with that vector, then the intermediate results should be saved for future jacobian evaluation, and should be kept until a jacobian evaluation is requested or until outputfcn is called with a different vector, in which case they should be dropped in favor of this most recent vector.  A short example how this can be achieved follows:

          function [fvec, fjac] = user_func (x, optimvalues, state)
          persistent sav = [], sav0 = [];
          if (nargin == 1)
            ## evaluation call
            if (nargout == 1)
              sav0.x = x; # mark saved vector
              ## calculate fvec, save results to sav0.
            elseif (nargout == 2)
              ## calculate fjac using sav.
            endif
          else
            ## outputfcn call.
            if (all (x == sav0.x))
              sav = sav0;
            endif
            ## maybe output iteration status, etc.
          endif
          endfunction

          Real parameters:

         `relax (`LPX_K_RELAX', default: 0.07)'
               Relaxation parameter used in the ratio test.  If it is zero, the textbook ratio test is used.  If it is non-zero (should be positive), Harris' two-pass ratio test is used.  In the latter case on the first pass of the ratio test basic variables (in the case of primal simplex) or reduced costs of non-basic variables (in the case of dual simplex) are allowed to slightly violate their bounds, but not more than `relax*tolbnd' or `relax*toldj (thus, `relax' is a percentage of `tolbnd' or `toldj''.

         `tolbnd (`LPX_K_TOLBND', default: 10e-7)'
               Relative tolerance used to check if the current basic solution is primal feasible.  It is not recommended that you change this parameter unless you have a detailed understanding of its purpose.

               Relative tolerance used to choose eligible pivotal elements of the simplex table.  It is not recommended that you change this parameter unless you have a detailed understanding of its purpose.

         `objll (`LPX_K_OBJLL', default: -DBL_MAX)'
               Lower limit of the objective function.  If on the phase II the objective function reaches this limit and continues decreasing, the solver stops the search.  This parameter is used in the dual simplex method only.

         `objul (`LPX_K_OBJUL', default: +DBL_MAX)'
               Upper limit of the objective function.  If on the phase II the objective function reaches this limit and continues increasing, the solver stops the search.  This parameter is used in the dual simplex only.

         `tmlim (`LPX_K_TMLIM', default: -1.0)'
               Searching time limit, in seconds.  If this value is positive, it is decreased each time when one simplex iteration has been performed by the amount of time spent for the iteration, and reaching zero value signals the solver to stop the search.  Negative value means no time limit.

         `outdly (`LPX_K_OUTDLY', default: 0.0)'
               Output delay, in seconds.  This parameter specifies how long the solver should delay sending information about the solution to the standard output.  Non-positive value means no delay.

         `tolint (`LPX_K_TOLINT', default: 10e-5)'
               Relative tolerance used to check if the current basic solution is integer feasible.  It is not recommended that you change this parameter unless you have a detailed understanding of its purpose.

         `tolobj (`LPX_K_TOLOBJ', default: 10e-7)'
               Relative tolerance used to check if the value of the objective function is not better than in the best known integer feasible solution.  It is not recommended that you change this parameter unless you have a detailed understanding of its purpose.

               lb <= x <= ub

     using a successive quadratic programming method.

     The first argument is the initial guess for the vector X.

     The second argument is a function handle pointing to the objective function.  The objective function must be of the form

               y = phi (x)

     in which X is a vector and Y is a scalar.

     The second argument may also be a 2- or 3-element cell array of function handles.  The first element should point to the objective function, the second should point to a function that computes the gradient of the objective function, and the third should point to a function to compute the hessian of the objective function.  If the gradient function is not supplied, the gradient is computed by finite differences.  If the hessian function is not supplied, a BFGS update formula is used to approximate the hessian.

     If supplied, the gradient function must be of the form

          g = gradient (x)

     in which X is a vector and G is a vector.

     If supplied, the hessian function must be of the form

          h = hessian (x)

     in which X is a vector and H is a matrix.

     The third and fourth arguments are function handles pointing to functions that compute the equality constraints and the inequality constraints, respectively.

     If your problem does not have equality (or inequality) constraints, you may pass an empty matrix for CEF (or CIF).

     If supplied, the equality and inequality constraint functions must be of the form

          r = f (x)

     in which X is a vector and R is a vector.

     The third and fourth arguments may also be 2-element cell arrays of function handles.  The first element should point to the constraint function and the second should point to a function that computes the gradient of the constraint function:

                          [ d f(x)   d f(x)        d f(x) ]
              transpose ( [ ------   -----   ...   ------ ] )
                          [  dx_1     dx_2          dx_N  ]

     The fifth and sixth arguments are vectors containing lower and upper bounds on X.  These must be consistent with equality and inequality constraints G and H.  If the bounds are not specified, or are empty, they are set to -REALMAX and REALMAX by default.

     The seventh argument is max. number of iterations.  If not specified, the default value is 100.

     The eighth argument is tolerance for stopping criteria.  If not specified, the default value is EPS.

     Here is an example of calling `sqp':

     The value returned in INFO may be one of the following:
    101
          The algorithm terminated because the norm of the last step was less than `tol * norm (x))' (the value of tol is currently fixed at `sqrt (eps)'--edit `sqp.m' to modify this value.

 -- Command: pkg COMMAND PKG_NAME
 -- Command: pkg COMMAND OPTION PKG_NAME
     This command interacts with the package manager.  Different actions will be taken depending on the value of COMMAND.

    `install'
          Install named packages.  For example,
               pkg install image-1.0.0.tar.gz
          installs the package found in the file `image-1.0.0.tar.gz'.

          The OPTION variable can contain options that affect the manner in which a package is installed.  These options can be one or more of

         `-nodeps'
               The package manager will disable the dependency checking.  That way it is possible to install a package even if it depends on another package that's not installed on the system.  *Use this option with care.*

         `-noauto'
               The package manager will not automatically load the installed package when starting Octave, even if the package requests that it is.

         `-auto'
               The package manager will automatically load the installed package when starting Octave, even if the package requests that it isn't.

         `-local'
               A local installation is forced, even if the user has system privileges.

         `-global'
               A global installation is forced, even if the user doesn't normally have system privileges

         `-verbose'
               The package manager will print the output of all of the commands that are performed.

    `uninstall'
          Uninstall named packages.  For example,
               pkg uninstall image
          removes the `image' package from the system.  If another installed package depends on the `image' package an error will be issued.  The package can be uninstalled anyway by using the `-nodeps' option.

    `load'
          Add named packages to the path.  After loading a package it is possible to use the functions provided by the package.  For example,
               pkg load image
          adds the `image' package to the path.  It is possible to load all installed packages at once with the command
               pkg load all

    `unload'
          Removes named packages from the path.  After unloading a package it is no longer possible to use the functions provided by the package.  This command behaves like the `load' command.

    `list'
          Show a list of the currently installed packages.  By requesting one or two output argument it is possible to get a list of the currently installed packages.  For example,
               installed_packages = pkg list;
          returns a cell array containing a structure for each installed package.  The command
               [USER_PACKAGES, SYSTEM_PACKAGES] = pkg list
          splits the list of installed packages into those who are installed by the current user, and those installed by the system administrator.

    `describe'
          Show a short description of the named installed packages, with the option '-verbose' also list functions provided by the package, e.g.:
                pkg describe -verbose all
          will describe all installed packages and the functions they provide.  If one output is requested a cell of structure containing the description and list of functions of each package is returned as output rather than printed on screen:
                desc = pkg ("describe", "secs1d", "image")
          If any of the requested packages is not installed, pkg returns an error, unless a second output is requested:
                [ desc, flag] = pkg ("describe", "secs1d", "image")
          FLAG will take one of the values "Not installed", "Loaded" or "Not loaded" for each of the named packages.

    `prefix'
          Set the installation prefix directory.  For example,
               pkg prefix ~/my_octave_packages
          sets the installation prefix to `~/my_octave_packages'.  Packages will be installed in this directory.

          It is possible to get the current installation prefix by requesting an output argument.  For example,
               p = pkg prefix

          The location in which to install the architecture dependent files can be independent specified with an addition argument.  For example

               pkg prefix ~/my_octave_packages ~/my_arch_dep_pkgs

    `local_list'
          Set the file in which to look for information on the locally installed packages.  Locally installed packages are those that are typically available only to the current user.  For example
               pkg local_list ~/.octave_packages
          It is possible to get the current value of local_list with the following
               pkg local_list

    `global_list'
          Set the file in which to look for, for information on the globally installed packages.  Globally installed packages are those that are typically available to all users.  For example
               pkg global_list /usr/share/octave/octave_packages
          It is possible to get the current value of global_list with the following
               pkg global_list

    `rebuild'
          Rebuilds the package database from the installed directories.  This can be used in cases where for some reason the package database is corrupted.  It can also take the `-auto' and `-noauto' options to allow the autoloading state of a package to be changed.  For example

               pkg rebuild -noauto image

          will remove the autoloading status of the image package.

    `build'
          Builds a binary form of a package or packages.  The binary file produced will itself be an Octave package that can be installed normally with `pkg'.  The form of the command to build a binary package is

               pkg build builddir image-1.0.0.tar.gz ...

          where `builddir' is the name of a directory where the temporary installation will be produced and the binary packages will be found.  The options `-verbose' and `-nodeps' are respected, while the other options are ignored.

# length: 2403
 -- Function File:  axis (LIMITS)
     Set axis limits for plots.

     The argument LIMITS should be a 2, 4, or 6 element vector.  The first and second elements specify the lower and upper limits for the x axis.  The third and fourth specify the limits for the y-axis, and the fifth and sixth specify the limits for the z-axis.

     Without any arguments, `axis' turns autoscaling on.

     With one output argument, `x = axis' returns the current axes

     The vector argument specifying limits is optional, and additional string arguments may be used to specify various axis properties.  For example,

          axis ([1, 2, 3, 4], "square");

     forces a square aspect ratio, and

          axis ("labely", "tic");

     turns tic marks on for all axes and tic mark labels on for the y-axis only.

     The following options control the aspect ratio of the axes.

    `"square"'
          Force a square aspect ratio.

    `"equal"'
          Force x distance to equal y-distance.

    `"normal"'
          Restore the balance.

     The following options control the way axis limits are interpreted.

    `"auto"'
          Set the specified axes to have nice limits around the data or all if no axes are specified.

    `"manual"'
          Fix the current axes limits.

    `"tight"'
          Fix axes to the limits of the data.

     The option `"image"' is equivalent to `"tight"' and `"equal"'.

     The following options affect the appearance of tic marks.

    `"on"'
          Turn tic marks and labels on for all axes.

    `"off"'
          Turn tic marks off for all axes.

    `"tic[xyz]"'
          Turn tic marks on for all axes, or turn them on for the specified axes and off for the remainder.

    `"label[xyz]"'
          Turn tic labels on for all axes, or turn them on for the specified axes and off for the remainder.

    `"nolabel"'
          Turn tic labels off for all axes.
     Note, if there are no tic marks for an axis, there can be no labels.

     The following options affect the direction of increasing values on the axes.

    `"ij"'
          Reverse y-axis, so lower values are nearer the top.

    `"xy"'
          Restore y-axis, so higher values are nearer the top.

     If an axes handle is passed as the first argument, then operate on this axes rather than the current axes.

     Produce a bar graph from two vectors of x-y data.

     If only one argument is given, it is taken as a vector of y-values and the x coordinates are taken to be the indices of the elements.

     The default width of 0.8 for the bars can be changed using W.

     If Y is a matrix, then each column of Y is taken to be a separate bar graph plotted on the same graph.  By default the columns are plotted side-by-side.  This behavior can be changed by the STYLE argument, which can take the values `"grouped"' (the default), or `"stacked"'.

     The optional return value H provides a handle to the "bar series" object with one handle per column of the variable Y.  This series allows common elements of the group of bar series objects to be changed in a single bar series and the same properties are changed in the other "bar series".  For example

          h = bar (rand (5, 10));
          set (h(1), "basevalue", 0.5);

     changes the position on the base of all of the bar series.

     The optional input handle H allows an axis handle to be passed.  Properties of the patch graphics object can be changed using PROP, VAL pairs.

     Adds labels to the contours of a contour plot.  The contour plot is specified by the contour matrix C and optionally the contourgroup object H that are returned by `contour', `contourf' and `contour3'.  The contour labels are rotated and placed in the contour itself.

     By default, all contours are labelled.  However, the contours to label can be specified by the vector V.  If the "manual" argument is given then the contours to label can be selected with the mouse.

     Additional property/value pairs that are valid properties of text objects can be given and are passed to the underlying text objects.  Additionally, the property "LabelSpacing" is available allowing the spacing between labels on a contour (in points) to be specified.  The default is 144 points, or 2 inches.

     The returned value H is the set of text object that represent the contour labels.  The "userdata" property of the text objects contains the numerical value of the contour label.

     An example of the use of `clabel' is

          [c, h] = contour (peaks(), -4 : 6);
          clabel (c, h, -4 : 2 : 6, 'fontsize', 12);

 -- Function File:  errorbar (ARGS)
     This function produces two-dimensional plots with errorbars.  Many different combinations of arguments are possible.  The simplest form is

          errorbar (Y, EY)

     where the first argument is taken as the set of Y coordinates and the second argument EY is taken as the errors of the Y values.  X coordinates are taken to be the indices of the elements, starting with 1.

     If more than two arguments are given, they are interpreted as

          errorbar (X, Y, ..., FMT, ...)

     where after X and Y there can be up to four error parameters such as EY, EX, LY, UY, etc., depending on the plot type.  Any number of argument sets may appear, as long as they are separated with a format string FMT.

     If Y is a matrix, X and error parameters must also be matrices having same dimensions.  The columns of Y are plotted versus the corresponding columns of X and errorbars are drawn from the corresponding columns of error parameters.

     If FMT is missing, yerrorbars ("~") plot style is assumed.

     If the FMT argument is supplied, it is interpreted as in normal plots.  In addition the following plot styles are supported by errorbar:

    `~'
          Set yerrorbars plot style (default).

    `>'
          Set xerrorbars plot style.

    `~>'
          Set xyerrorbars plot style.

    `#'
          Set boxes plot style.

    `#~'
          Set boxerrorbars plot style.

    `#~>'
          Set boxxyerrorbars plot style.

     Examples:

          errorbar (X, Y, EX, ">")

     produces an xerrorbar plot of Y versus X with X errorbars drawn from X-EX to X+EX.

          errorbar (X, Y1, EY, "~",
                    X, Y2, LY, UY)

     produces yerrorbar plots with Y1 and Y2 versus X.  Errorbars for Y1 are drawn from Y1-EY to Y1+EY, errorbars for Y2 from Y2-LY to Y2+UY.

          errorbar (X, Y, LX, UX,
                    LY, UY, "~>")

     produces an xyerrorbar plot of Y versus X in which X errorbars are drawn from X-LX to X+UX and Y errorbars from Y-LY to Y+UY.  See also: semilogxerr, semilogyerr, loglogerr.

     Find object with specified property values.  The simplest form is

          findobj (PROP_NAME, PROP_VALUE)

     which returns all of the handles to the objects with the name PROP_NAME and the name PROP_VALUE.  The search can be limited to a particular object or set of objects and their descendants by passing a handle or set of handles H as the first argument to `findobj'.

     The depth of hierarchy of objects to which to search to can be limited with the '-depth' argument.  To limit the number depth of the hierarchy to search to D generations of children, and example is

          findobj (H, '-depth', D, PROP_NAME, PROP_VALUE)

     Specifying a depth D of 0, limits the search to the set of object passed in H.  A depth D of 0 is equivalent to the '-flat' argument.

     A specified logical operator may be applied to the pairs of PROP_NAME and PROP_VALUE.  The supported logical operators are '-and', '-or', '-xor', '-not'.

     The objects may also be matched by comparing a regular expression to the property values, where property values that match `regexp (PROP_VALUE, PATTERN)' are returned.  Finally, objects may be matched by property name only, using the '-property' option.  See also: get, set.

     If called with one output argument and the first input argument C is a three-dimensional array that contains color values and the second input argument V keeps the vertices of a geometry then return a matrix CD with color data information for the geometry at computed points `[x, y, z] = meshgrid (1:l, 1:m, 1:n)'.  The output argument CD can be taken to manually set FaceVertexCData of a patch.

     If called with further input arguments X, Y and Z which are three-dimensional arrays of the same size than C then the color data is taken at those given points.  Instead of the color data C this function can also be called with RGB values R, G, B.  If input argumnets X, Y, Z are not given then again `meshgrid' computed values are taken.

     Optionally, the patch handle P can be given as the last input argument to all variations of function calls instead of the vertices data V.  Finally, if no output argument is given then directly change the colors of a patch that is given by the patch handle P.

     Draw a Pareto chart, also called ABC chart.  A Pareto chart is a bar graph used to arrange information in such a way that priorities for process improvement can be established.  It organizes and displays information to show the relative importance of data.  The chart is similar to the histogram or bar chart, except that the bars are arranged in decreasing order from left to right along the abscissa.

     The fundamental idea (Pareto principle) behind the use of Pareto diagrams is that the majority of an effect is due to a small subset of the causes, so for quality improvement the first few (as presented on the diagram) contributing causes to a problem usually account for the majority of the result.  Thus, targeting these "major causes" for elimination results in the most cost-effective improvement scheme.

     The data are passed as X and the abscissa as Y.  If Y is absent, then the abscissa are assumed to be `1 : length (X)'.  Y can be a string array, a cell array of strings or a numerical vector.

     An example of the use of `pareto' is

          Cheese = {"Cheddar", "Swiss", "Camembert", ...
                    "Munster", "Stilton", "Blue"};

     Density plot for given matrices X, and Y from `meshgrid' and a matrix C corresponding to the X and Y coordinates of the mesh's vertices.  If X and Y are vectors, then a typical vertex is (X(j), Y(i), C(i,j)).  Thus, columns of C correspond to different X values and rows of C correspond to different Y values.

     The `colormap' is scaled to the extents of C.  Limits may be placed on the color axis by the command `caxis', or by setting the `clim' property of the parent axis.

     The face color of each cell of the mesh is determined by interpolating the values of C for the cell's vertices.  Contrast this with `imagesc' which renders one cell for each element of C.

     `shading' modifies an attribute determining the manner by which the face color of each cell is interpolated from the values of C, and the visibility of the cells' edges.  By default the attribute is "faceted", which renders a single color for each cell's face with the edge visible.

     H is the handle to the surface object.

     Produces two-dimensional plots.  Many different combinations of arguments are possible.  The simplest form is

          plot (Y)

     where the argument is taken as the set of Y coordinates and the X coordinates are taken to be the indices of the elements, starting with 1.

     To save a plot, in one of several image formats such as PostScript or PNG, use the `print' command.

     If more than one argument is given, they are interpreted as

          plot (Y, PROPERTY, VALUE, ...)

     or

          plot (X, Y, PROPERTY, VALUE, ...)

     or

          plot (X, Y, FMT, ...)

     and so on.  Any number of argument sets may appear.  The X and Y values are interpreted as follows:

        * If a single data argument is supplied, it is taken as the set of Y coordinates and the X coordinates are taken to be the indices of the elements, starting with 1.

        * If the X is a vector and Y is a matrix, then the columns (or rows) of Y are plotted versus X.  (using whichever combination matches, with columns tried first.)

        * If the X is a matrix and Y is a vector, Y is plotted versus the columns (or rows) of X.  (using whichever combination matches, with columns tried first.)

        * If both arguments are vectors, the elements of Y are plotted versus the elements of X.

        * If both arguments are matrices, the columns of Y are plotted versus the columns of X.  In this case, both matrices must have the same number of rows and columns and no attempt is made to transpose the arguments to make the number of rows match.

          If both arguments are scalars, a single point is plotted.

     Multiple property-value pairs may be specified, but they must appear in pairs.  These arguments are applied to the lines drawn by `plot'.

     If the FMT argument is supplied, it is interpreted as follows.  If FMT is missing, the default gnuplot line style is assumed.

    `-'
          Set lines plot style (default).

    `.'
          Set dots plot style.

    `N'
          Interpreted as the plot color if N is an integer in the range 1 to 6.

    `NM'
          If NM is a two digit integer and M is an integer in the range 1 to 6, M is interpreted as the point style.  This is only valid in combination with the `@' or `-@' specifiers.

    `C'
          If C is one of `"k"' (black), `"r"' (red), `"g"' (green), `"b"' (blue), `"m"' (magenta), `"c"' (cyan), or `"w"' (white), it is interpreted as the line plot color.

    `";title;"'
          Here `"title"' is the label for the key.

    `+'
    `*'
    `o'
    `x'
    `^'
          Used in combination with the points or linespoints styles, set the point style.

     The FMT argument may also be used to assign key titles.  To do so, include the desired title between semi-colons after the formatting sequence described above, e.g., "+3;Key Title;" Note that the last semi-colon is required and will generate an error if it is left out.

     Here are some plot examples:

          plot (x, y, "@12", x, y2, x, y3, "4", x, y4, "+")

     This command will plot `y' with points of type 2 (displayed as `+') and color 1 (red), `y2' with lines, `y3' with lines of color 4 (magenta) and `y4' with points displayed as `+'.

          plot (b, "*", "markersize", 3)

     This command will plot the data in the variable `b', with points displayed as `*' with a marker size of 3.

          t = 0:0.1:6.3;
          plot (t, cos(t), "-;cos(t);", t, sin(t), "+3;sin(t);");

     This will plot the cosine and sine functions and label them accordingly in the key.

     If the first argument is an axis handle, then plot into these axes, rather than the current axis handle returned by `gca'.  See also: semilogx, semilogy, loglog, polar, mesh, contour, bar, stairs, errorbar, xlabel, ylabel, title, print.

     Produce three-dimensional plots.  Many different combinations of arguments are possible.  The simplest form is

          plot3 (X, Y, Z)

     in which the arguments are taken to be the vertices of the points to be plotted in three dimensions.  If all arguments are vectors of the same length, then a single continuous line is drawn.

     If only two arguments are given, as

          plot3 (X, C)

     the real and imaginary parts of the second argument are used as the Y and Z coordinates, respectively.

     If only one argument is given, as

          plot3 (C)

     the real and imaginary parts of the argument are used as the Y and Z values, and they are plotted versus their index.

     Arguments may also be given in groups of three as

          plot3 (X1, Y1, Z1, X2, Y2, Z2, ...)

     in which each set of three arguments is treated as a separate line or set of lines in three dimensions.

     To plot multiple one- or two-argument groups, separate each group with an empty format string, as

          plot3 (X1, C1, "", C2, "", ...)

     An example of the use of `plot3' is

     Scatter plot of the columns of one matrix against another.  Given the arguments X and Y, that have a matching number of rows, `plotmatrix' plots a set of axes corresponding to

          plot (X (:, i), Y (:, j)

     Given a single argument X, then this is equivalent to

          plotmatrix (X, X)

     except that the diagonal of the set of axes will be replaced with the histogram `hist (X (:, i))'.

     The marker to use can be changed with the STYLE argument, that is a string defining a marker in the same manner as the `plot' command.  If a leading axes handle H is passed to `plotmatrix', then this axis will be used for the plot.

     The optional return value H provides handles to the individual graphics objects in the scatter plots, whereas AX returns the handles to the scatter plot axis objects.  BIGAX is a hidden axis object that surrounds the other axes, such that the commands `xlabel', `title', etc., will be associated with this hidden axis.  Finally P returns the graphics objects associated with the histogram and PAX the corresponding axes objects.

     Plots two sets of data with independent y-axes.  The arguments X1 and Y1 define the arguments for the first plot and X1 and Y2 for the second.

     By default the arguments are evaluated with `feval (@plot, X, Y)'.  However the type of plot can be modified with the FUN argument, in which case the plots are generated by `feval (FUN, X, Y)'.  FUN can be a function handle, an inline function or a string of a function name.

     The function to use for each of the plots can be independently defined with FUN1 and FUN2.

     If given, H defines the principal axis in which to plot the X1 and Y1 data.  The return value AX is a two element vector with the axis handles of the two plots.  H1 and H2 are handles to the objects generated by the plot commands.

 -- Function File: H = slice (...)
 -- Function File: H = slice (..., METHOD)
     Plot slices of 3D data/scalar fields.  Each element of the 3-dimensional array V represents a scalar value at a location given by the parameters X, Y, and Z.  The parameters X, X, and Z are either 3-dimensional arrays of the same size as the array V in the "meshgrid" format or vectors.  The parameters XI, etc. respect a similar format to X, etc., and they represent the points at which the array VI is interpolated using interp3.  The vectors SX, SY, and SZ contain points of orthogonal slices of the respective axes.

     If X, Y, Z are omitted, they are assumed to be `x = 1:size (V, 2)', `y = 1:size (V, 1)' and `z = 1:size (V, 3)'.

     METHOD is one of:

    `"nearest"'
          Return the nearest neighbor.

    `"linear"'
          Linear interpolation from nearest neighbors.

    `"cubic"'
          Cubic interpolation from four nearest neighbors (not implemented yet).

    `"spline"'
          Cubic spline interpolation--smooth first and second derivatives throughout the curve.

     The default method is `"linear"'.  The optional return value H is a vector of handles to the surface graphic objects.

     Examples:
          [x, y, z] = meshgrid (linspace (-8, 8, 32));
          v = sin (sqrt (x.^2 + y.^2 + z.^2)) ./ (sqrt (x.^2 + y.^2 + z.^2));

 -- Function File: H = stem (X, Y, LINESPEC)
 -- Function File: H = stem (..., "filled")
     Plot a stem graph from two vectors of x-y data.  If only one argument is given, it is taken as the y-values and the x coordinates are taken from the indices of the elements.

     If Y is a matrix, then each column of the matrix is plotted as a separate stem graph.  In this case X can either be a vector, the same length as the number of rows in Y, or it can be a matrix of the same size as Y.

     The default color is `"r"' (red).  The default line style is `"-"' and the default marker is `"o"'.  The line style can be altered by the `linespec' argument in the same manner as the `plot' command.  For example

          x = 1:10;
          y = ones (1, length (x))*2.*x;
          stem (x, y, "b");

     plots 10 stems with heights from 2 to 20 in blue;

     The return value of `stem' is a vector if "stem series" graphics handles, with one handle per column of the variable Y.  This handle regroups the elements of the stem graph together as the children of the "stem series" handle, allowing them to be altered together.  For example

          x = [0 : 10].';
          y = [sin(x), cos(x)]
          h = stem (x, y);
          set (h(2), "color", "g");
          set (h(1), "basevalue", -1)

     For example,
          theta = 0:0.2:6;
          stem3 (cos (theta), sin (theta), theta)

     plots 31 stems with heights from 0 to 6 lying on a circle.  Color definitions with rgb-triples are not valid!  See also: bar, barh, stem, plot.

 -- Function File:  subplot (RCN)
     Set up a plot grid with COLS by ROWS subwindows and plot in location given by INDEX.

     If only one argument is supplied, then it must be a three digit value specifying the location in digits 1 (rows) and 2 (columns) and the plot index in digit 3.

     The plot index runs row-wise.  First all the columns in a row are filled and then the next row is filled.

     For example, a plot with 2 by 3 grid will have plot indices running as follows:

               +-----+-----+-----+
               |  1  |  2  |  3  |

If X and Y are vectors, then a typical vertex is (X(j), Y(i), Z(i,j)).  Thus, columns of Z correspond to different X values and rows of Z correspond to different Y values.

     The light direction can be specified using L.  It can be given as 2-element vector [azimuth, elevation] in degrees or as 3-element vector [lx, ly, lz].  The default value is rotated 45° counter-clockwise from the current view.

     The material properties of the surface can specified using a 4-element vector P = [AM D SP EXP] which defaults to P = [0.55 0.6 0.4 10].
    `"AM" strength of ambient light'

    `"D" strength of diffuse reflection'

    `"SP" strength of specular reflection'

    `"EXP" specular exponent'

     The default lighting mode "cdata", changes the cdata property to give the impression of a lighted surface.  Please note: the alternative "light" mode, which creates a light object to illuminate the surface is not implemented (yet).

     Find the vectors normal to a meshgridded surface.  The meshed gridded surface is defined by X, Y, and Z.  If X and Y are not defined, then it is assumed that they are given by

          [X, Y] = meshgrid (1:size(Z, 1),
                               1:size(Z, 2));

     If no return arguments are requested, a surface plot with the normal vectors to the surface is plotted.  Otherwise the components of the normal vectors at the mesh gridded points are returned in NX, NY, and NZ.

     The normal vectors are calculated by taking the cross product of the diagonals of each of the quadrilaterals in the meshgrid to find the normal vectors of the centers of these quadrilaterals.  The four nearest normal vectors to the meshgrid points are then averaged to obtain the normal to the surface at the meshgridded points.

 -- Function File: PP = mkpp (X, P)
 -- Function File: PP = mkpp (X, P, D)
     Construct a piece-wise polynomial structure from sample points X and coefficients P.  The i-th row of P, `P (I,:)', contains the coefficients for the polynomial over the I-th interval, ordered from highest to lowest.  There must be one row for each interval in X, so `rows (P) == length (X) - 1'.

     You can concatenate multiple polynomials of the same order over the same set of intervals using `P = [ P1; P2; ...; PD ]'.  In this case, `rows (P) == D * (length (X) - 1)'.

     D specifies the shape of the matrix P for all except the last dimension.  If D is not specified it will be computed as `round (rows (P) / (length (X) - 1))' instead.

     Identify unique poles in P and associates their multiplicity, ordering them from largest to smallest.

     If the relative difference of the poles is less than TOL, then they are considered to be multiples.  The default value for TOL is 0.001.

     If the optional parameter REORDER is zero, poles are not sorted.

     The value MULTP is a vector specifying the multiplicity of the poles.  MULTP(:) refers to multiplicity of P(INDX(:)).

     Piecewise Cubic Hermite interpolating polynomial.  Called with two arguments, the piece-wise polynomial PP is returned, that may later be used with `ppval' to evaluate the polynomial at specific points.

     The variable X must be a strictly monotonic vector (either increasing or decreasing).  While Y can be either a vector or array.  In the case where Y is a vector, it must have a length of N.  If Y is an array, then the size of Y must have the form `[S1, S2, ..., SK, N]' The array is then reshaped internally to a matrix where the leading dimension is given by `S1 * S2 * ... * SK' and each row in this matrix is then treated separately.  Note that this is exactly the opposite treatment than `interp1' and is done for compatibility.

     Called with a third input argument, `pchip' evaluates the piece-wise polynomial at the points XI.  There is an equivalence between `ppval (pchip (X, Y), XI)' and `pchip (X, Y, XI)'.

     If A is a square N-by-N matrix, `poly (A)' is the row vector of the coefficients of `det (z * eye (N) - a)', the characteristic polynomial of A.  As an example we can use this to find the eigenvalues of A as the roots of `poly (A)'.

     In real-life examples you should, however, use the `eig' function for computing eigenvalues.

     If X is a vector, `poly (X)' is a vector of coefficients of the polynomial whose roots are the elements of X.  That is, of C is a polynomial, then the elements of `D = roots (poly (C))' are contained in C.  The vectors C and D are, however, not equal due to sorting and numerical errors.

     Return the cubic spline interpolant of Y at points X.  If called with two arguments, `spline' returns the piece-wise polynomial PP that may later be used with `ppval' to evaluate the polynomial at specific points.  If called with a third input argument, `spline' evaluates the spline at the points XI.  There is an equivalence between `ppval (spline (X, Y), XI)' and `spline (X, Y, XI)'.

     The variable X must be a vector of length N, and Y can be either a vector or array.  In the case where Y is a vector, it can have a length of either N or `N + 2'.  If the length of Y is N, then the 'not-a-knot' end condition is used.  If the length of Y is `N + 2', then the first and last values of the vector Y are the values of the first derivative of the cubic spline at the end-points.

     If Y is an array, then the size of Y must have the form `[S1, S2, ..., SK, N]' or `[S1, S2, ..., SK, N + 2]'.  The array is then reshaped internally to a matrix where the leading dimension is given by `S1 * S2 * ... * SK' and each row of this matrix is then treated separately.  Note that this is exactly the opposite treatment than `interp1' and is done for compatibility.  See also: ppval, mkpp, unmkpp.

 -- Function File: [X, P, N, K, D] = unmkpp (PP)
     Extract the components of a piece-wise polynomial structure PP.  These are as follows:

    X
          Sample points.

    P
          Polynomial coefficients for points in sample interval.  `P (I, :)' contains the coefficients for the polynomial over interval I ordered from highest to lowest.  If `D > 1', `P (R, I, :)' contains the coefficients for the r-th polynomial defined on interval I.  However, this is stored as a 2-D array such that `C = reshape (P (:, J), N, D)' gives `C (I,  R)' is the j-th coefficient of the r-th polynomial over the i-th interval.

    N
          Number of polynomial pieces.

    K
          Order of the polynomial plus 1.

    D
          Number of polynomials defined for each interval.

 -- Function File: [X, FLAG, RELRES, ITER, RESVEC, EIGEST] = pcg (...)
     Solves the linear system of equations `A * X = B' by means of the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient iterative method.  The input arguments are

        * A can be either a square (preferably sparse) matrix or a function handle, inline function or string containing the name of a function which computes `A * X'.  In principle A should be symmetric and positive definite; if `pcg' finds A to not be positive definite, you will get a warning message and the FLAG output parameter will be set.

        * B is the right hand side vector.

        * TOL is the required relative tolerance for the residual error, `B - A * X'.  The iteration stops if `norm (B - A * X) <= TOL * norm (B - A * X0)'.  If TOL is empty or is omitted, the function sets `TOL = 1e-6' by default.

        * MAXIT is the maximum allowable number of iterations; if `[]' is supplied for `maxit', or `pcg' has less arguments, a default value equal to 20 is used.

        * M = M1 * M2 is the (left) preconditioning matrix, so that the iteration is (theoretically) equivalent to solving by `pcg' `P * X = M \ B', with `P = M \ A'.  Note that a proper choice of the preconditioner may dramatically improve the overall performance of the method.  Instead of matrices M1 and M2, the user may pass two functions which return the results of applying the inverse of M1 and M2 to a vector (usually this is the preferred way of using the preconditioner).  If `[]' is supplied for M1, or M1 is omitted, no preconditioning is applied.  If M2 is omitted, M = M1 will be used as preconditioner.

        * X0 is the initial guess.  If X0 is empty or omitted, the function sets X0 to a zero vector by default.

     The arguments which follow X0 are treated as parameters, and passed in a proper way to any of the functions (A or M) which are passed to `pcg'.  See the examples below for further details.  The output arguments are

        * X is the computed approximation to the solution of `A * X = B'.

        * FLAG reports on the convergence.  `FLAG = 0' means the solution converged and the tolerance criterion given by TOL is satisfied.  `FLAG = 1' means that the MAXIT limit for the iteration count was reached.  `FLAG = 3' reports that the (preconditioned) matrix was found not positive definite.

        * RELRES is the ratio of the final residual to its initial value, measured in the Euclidean norm.

        * ITER is the actual number of iterations performed.

        * RESVEC describes the convergence history of the method.  `RESVEC (i,1)' is the Euclidean norm of the residual, and `RESVEC (i,2)' is the preconditioned residual norm, after the (I-1)-th iteration, `I = 1, 2, ..., ITER+1'.  The preconditioned residual norm is defined as `norm (R) ^ 2 = R' * (M \ R)' where `R = B - A * X', see also the description of M.  If EIGEST is not required, only `RESVEC (:,1)' is returned.

        * EIGEST returns the estimate for the smallest `EIGEST (1)' and largest `EIGEST (2)' eigenvalues of the preconditioned matrix `P = M \ A'.  In particular, if no preconditioning is used, the estimates for the extreme eigenvalues of A are returned.  `EIGEST (1)' is an overestimate and `EIGEST (2)' is an underestimate, so that `EIGEST (2) / EIGEST (1)' is a lower bound for `cond (P, 2)', which nevertheless in the limit should theoretically be equal to the actual value of the condition number.  The method which computes EIGEST works only for symmetric positive definite A and M, and the user is responsible for verifying this assumption.

     Let us consider a trivial problem with a diagonal matrix (we exploit the sparsity of A)

          	n = 10;
          	a = diag (sparse (1:n));

     Solves the linear system of equations `A * X = B' by means of the Preconditioned Conjugate Residuals iterative method.  The input arguments are

        * A can be either a square (preferably sparse) matrix or a function handle, inline function or string containing the name of a function which computes `A * X'.  In principle A should be symmetric and non-singular; if `pcr' finds A to be numerically singular, you will get a warning message and the FLAG output parameter will be set.

Instead of matrix M, the user may pass a function which returns the results of applying the inverse of M to a vector (usually this is the preferred way of using the preconditioner).  If `[]' is supplied for M, or M is omitted, no preconditioning is applied.

        * X0 is the initial guess.  If X0 is empty or omitted, the function sets X0 to a zero vector by default.

     The arguments which follow X0 are treated as parameters, and passed in a proper way to any of the functions (A or M) which are passed to `pcr'.  See the examples below for further details.  The output arguments are

        * X is the computed approximation to the solution of `A * X = B'.

        * FLAG reports on the convergence.  `FLAG = 0' means the solution converged and the tolerance criterion given by TOL is satisfied.  `FLAG = 1' means that the MAXIT limit for the iteration count was reached.  `FLAG = 3' reports t `pcr' breakdown, see [1] for details.

        * RELRES is the ratio of the final residual to its initial value, measured in the Euclidean norm.

        * ITER is the actual number of iterations performed.

        * RESVEC describes the convergence history of the method, so that `RESVEC (i)' contains the Euclidean norms of the residual after the (I-1)-th iteration, `I = 1,2, ..., ITER+1'.

     Let us consider a trivial problem with a diagonal matrix (we exploit the sparsity of A)

          	n = 10;
          	a = sparse (diag (1:n));
          	b = rand (N, 1);

     EXAMPLE 1: Simplest use of `pcr'

            x = pcr(A, b)

     EXAMPLE 2: `pcr' with a function which computes `A * X'.

            function y = apply_a (x)

            x = pcr ("apply_a", b)

     EXAMPLE 3:  Preconditioned iteration, with full diagnostics.  The preconditioner (quite strange, because even the original matrix A is trivial) is defined as a function

            function y = apply_m (x)
              k = floor (length(x)-2);
              y = x;

 -- Function File: S = spalloc (R, C, NZ)
     Returns an empty sparse matrix of size R-by-C.  As Octave resizes sparse matrices at the first opportunity, so that no additional space is needed, the argument NZ is ignored.  This function is provided only for compatibility reasons.

     It should be noted that this means that code like

          k = 5;
          nz = r * k;
          s = spalloc (r, c, nz)
          for j = 1:c
            idx = randperm (r);
            s (:, j) = [zeros(r - k, 1); rand(k, 1)] (idx);
          endfor

     will reallocate memory at each step.  It is therefore vitally important that code like this is vectorized as much as possible.  See also: sparse, nzmax.

 -- Function File: S = spaugment (A, C)
     Creates the augmented matrix of A.  This is given by

          [C * eye(M, M),A; A', zeros(N,
          N)]

     This is related to the least squares solution of `A \\ B', by

          S * [ R / C; x] = [B, zeros(N,
          columns(B)]

     where R is the residual error

          R = B - A * X

     As the matrix S is symmetric indefinite it can be factorized with `lu', and the minimum norm solution can therefore be found without the need for a `qr' factorization.  As the residual error will be `zeros (M, M)' for under determined problems, and example can be

          m = 11; n = 10; mn = max(m ,n);
          a = spdiags ([ones(mn,1), 10*ones(mn,1), -ones(mn,1)],
                       [-1, 0, 1], m, n);
          x0 = a \ ones (m,1);
          s = spaugment (a);
          [L, U, P, Q] = lu (s);
          x1 = Q * (U \ (L \ (P  * [ones(m,1); zeros(n,1)])));
          x1 = x1(end - n + 1 : end);

     To find the solution of an overdetermined problem needs an estimate of the residual error R and so it is more complex to formulate a minimum norm solution using the `spaugment' function.

     In general the left division operator is more stable and faster than using the `spaugment' function.

 -- Function File: X = spconvert (M)
     This function converts for a simple sparse matrix format easily produced by other programs into Octave's internal sparse format.  The input X is either a 3 or 4 column real matrix, containing the row, column, real and imaginary parts of the elements of the sparse matrix.  An element with a zero real and imaginary part can be used to force a particular matrix size.

 -- Function File: B = spdiags (A, C)
 -- Function File: B = spdiags (V, C, A)
 -- Function File: B = spdiags (V, C, M, N)
     A generalization of the function `diag'.  Called with a single input argument, the non-zero diagonals C of A are extracted.  With two arguments the diagonals to extract are given by the vector C.

     The other two forms of `spdiags' modify the input matrix by replacing the diagonals.  They use the columns of V to replace the columns represented by the vector C.  If the sparse matrix A is defined then the diagonals of this matrix are replaced.  Otherwise a matrix of M by N is created with the diagonals given by V.

     Negative values of C represent diagonals below the main diagonal, and positive values of C diagonals above the main diagonal.

          S = eigs([sparse(M, M), A; ...
                          A', sparse(N, N)])

     The eigenvalues returned by `eigs' correspond to the singular values of A.  The number of singular values to calculate is given by K, whose default value is 6.

     The argument SIGMA can be used to specify which singular values to find.  SIGMA can be either the string 'L', the default, in which case the largest singular values of A are found.  Otherwise SIGMA should be a real scalar, in which case the singular values closest to SIGMA are found.  Note that for relatively small values of SIGMA, there is the chance that the requested number of singular values are not returned.  In that case SIGMA should be increased.

     If OPTS is given, then it is a structure that defines options that `svds' will pass to EIGS.  The possible fields of this structure are therefore determined by `eigs'.  By default three fields of this structure are set by `svds'.

    `tol'
          The required convergence tolerance for the singular values.  `eigs' is passed TOL divided by `sqrt(2)'.  The default value is 1e-10.

    `maxit'
          The maximum number of iterations.  The default is 300.

    `disp'
          The level of diagnostic printout.  If `disp' is 0 then there is no printout.  The default value is 0.

     If more than one output argument is given, then `svds' also calculates the left and right singular vectors of A.  FLAG is used to signal the convergence of `svds'.  If `svds' converges to the desired tolerance, then FLAG given by

          norm (A * V - U * S, 1) <= ...
                  TOL * norm (A, 1)

     If ALPHA is a scalar, the result is the same size as X.  If X is a scalar, the result is the same size as ALPHA.  If ALPHA is a row vector and X is a column vector, the result is a matrix with `length (X)' rows and `length (ALPHA)' columns.

     The validity of this formula can easily be checked by expanding the binomial coefficients in both formulas as factorials.  It can be derived more directly via the theory of Cauchy matrices: see J. W. Demmel, Applied Numerical Linear Algebra, page 92.

     Compare this with the numerical calculation of `inverse (hilb (n))', which suffers from the ill-conditioning of the Hilbert matrix, and the finite precision of your computer's floating point arithmetic.  See also: hankel, vander, sylvester_matrix, hilb, toeplitz.

 -- Function File: N = histc (Y, EDGES)
 -- Function File: N = histc (Y, EDGES, DIM)
 -- Function File: [N, IDX] = histc (...)
     Produce histogram counts.

     When Y is a vector, the function counts the number of elements of Y that fall in the histogram bins defined by EDGES.  This must be a vector of monotonically non-decreasing values that define the edges of the histogram bins.  So, `N (k)' contains the number of elements in Y for which `EDGES (k) <= Y < EDGES (k+1)'.  The final element of N contains the number of elements of Y that was equal to the last element of EDGES.

     When Y is a N-dimensional array, the same operation as above is repeated along dimension DIM.  If this argument is given, the operation is performed along the first non-singleton dimension.

     If a second output argument is requested an index matrix is also returned.  The IDX matrix has same size as Y.  Each element of IDX contains the index of the histogram bin in which the corresponding element of Y was counted.

     Continuous sample quantile methods 4 through 9, where p(k) is the linear interpolation function respecting each methods' representative cdf.

       4. Method 4: p(k) = k / n. That is, linear interpolation of the empirical cdf.

       5. Method 5: p(k) = (k - 0.5) / n. That is a piecewise linear function where the knots are the values midway through the steps of the empirical cdf.

       6. Method 6: p(k) = k / (n + 1).

       7. Method 7: p(k) = (k - 1) / (n - 1).

       8. Method 8: p(k) = (k - 1/3) / (n + 1/3).  The resulting quantile estimates are approximately median-unbiased regardless of the distribution of X.

       9. Method 9: p(k) = (k - 3/8) / (n + 1/4).  The resulting quantile estimates are approximately unbiased for the expected order statistics if X is normally distributed.

     Hyndman and Fan (1996) recommend method 8.  Maxima, S, and R (versions prior to 2.0.0) use 7 as their default.  Minitab and SPSS use method 6.  MATLAB uses method 5.

 -- Function File: [THETA, BETA, DEV, DL, D2L, P] = logistic_regression (Y, X, PRINT, THETA, BETA)
     Perform ordinal logistic regression.

     Suppose Y takes values in K ordered categories, and let `gamma_i (X)' be the cumulative probability that Y falls in one of the first I categories given the covariate X.  Then

          [theta, beta] = logistic_regression (y, x)

     fits the model

          logit (gamma_i (x)) = theta_i - beta' * x,   i = 1 ... k-1

     The number of ordinal categories, K, is taken to be the number of distinct values of `round (Y)'.  If K equals 2, Y is binary and the model is ordinary logistic regression.  The matrix X is assumed to have full column rank.

     Given Y only, `theta = logistic_regression (y)' fits the model with baseline logit odds only.

     The full form is

          [theta, beta, dev, dl, d2l, gamma]
             = logistic_regression (y, x, print, theta, beta)

     in which all output arguments and all input arguments except Y are optional.

     Setting PRINT to 1 requests summary information about the fitted model to be displayed.  Setting PRINT to 2 requests information about convergence at each iteration.  Other values request no information to be displayed.  The input arguments THETA and BETA give initial estimates for THETA and BETA.

     The returned value DEV holds minus twice the log-likelihood.

     The returned values DL and D2L are the vector of first and the matrix of second derivatives of the log-likelihood with respect to THETA and BETA.

     P holds estimates for the conditional distribution of Y given X.

 -- Function File: [NUM, STATUS, STRARRAY] = str2double (STR, CDELIM, RDELIM, DDELIM)
     Convert strings into numeric values.

     `str2double' can replace `str2num', but avoids the use of `eval' on unknown data.

     STR can be the form `[+-]d[.]dd[[eE][+-]ddd]' in which `d' can be any of digit from 0 to 9, and `[]' indicate optional elements.

     NUM is the corresponding numeric value.  If the conversion fails, status is -1 and NUM is NaN.

     STATUS is 0 if the conversion was successful and -1 otherwise.

     STRARRAY is a cell array of strings.

     Elements which are not defined or not valid return NaN and the STATUS becomes -1.

     If STR is a character array or a cell array of strings, then NUM and STATUS return matrices of appropriate size.

     STR can also contain multiple elements separated by row and column delimiters (CDELIM and RDELIM).

     The parameters CDELIM, RDELIM, and DDELIM are optional column, row, and decimal delimiters.

     The default row-delimiters are newline, carriage return and semicolon (ASCII 10, 13 and 59).  The default column-delimiters are tab, space and comma (ASCII 9, 32, and 44).  The default decimal delimiter is `.' (ASCII 46).

     Return a string containing all the arguments concatenated horizontally.  If the arguments are cells strings,  `strcat' returns a cell string with the individual cells concatenated.  For numerical input, each element is converted to the corresponding ASCII character.  Trailing white space is eliminated.  For example,

     Ignoring case, return 1 if the first N characters of character strings (or character arrays) S1 and S2 are the same, and 0 otherwise.

     If either S1 or S2 is a cell array of strings, then an array of the same size is returned, containing the values described above for every member of the cell array.  The other argument may also be a cell array of strings (of the same size or with only one element), char matrix or character string.

     Remove leading and trailing blanks and nulls from S.  If S is a matrix, STRTRIM trims each row to the length of longest string.  If S is a cell array, operate recursively on each element of the cell array.  For example:

          strtrim ("    abc  ")
               => "abc"

     Truncate the character string S to length N.  If S is a char matrix, then the number of columns is adjusted.

     If S is a cell array of strings, then the operation is performed on its members and the new cell array is returned.

 -- Function File:  substr (S, OFFSET, LEN)
     Return the substring of S which starts at character number OFFSET and is LEN characters long.

     If OFFSET is negative, extraction starts that far from the end of the string.  If LEN is omitted, the substring extends to the end of S.

     For example,

          substr ("This is a test string", 6, 9)
               => "is a test"

     This function is patterned after AWK.  You can get the same result by `S(OFFSET : (OFFSET + LEN - 1))'.

     Verify that STR is a string or substring of an element of STRARRAY.

     STR is a character string to be tested, and STRARRAY is a cellstr of valid values.  VALIDSTR will be the validated form of STR where validation is defined as STR being a member or substring of VALIDSTR.  If STR is a substring of VALIDSTR and there are multiple matches, the shortest match will be returned if all matches are substrings of each other, and an error will be raised if the matches are not substrings of each other.

     Produces an error if the condition is not met.  `assert' can be called in three different ways.

    `assert (COND)'
    `assert (COND, ERRMSG, ...)'
    `assert (COND, MSG_ID, ERRMSG, ...)'
          Called with a single argument COND, `assert' produces an error if COND is zero.  If called with a single argument a generic error message.  With more than one argument, the additional arguments are passed to the `error' function.

    `assert (OBSERVED, EXPECTED)'
          Produce an error if observed is not the same as expected.  Note that observed and expected can be strings, scalars, vectors, matrices, lists or structures.

    `assert(OBSERVED, EXPECTED, TOL)'
          Accept a tolerance when comparing numbers.  If TOL is positive use it as an absolute tolerance, will produce an error if `abs(OBSERVED - EXPECTED) > abs(TOL)'.  If TOL is negative use it as a relative tolerance, will produce an error if `abs(OBSERVED - EXPECTED) > abs(TOL * EXPECTED)'.  If EXPECTED is zero TOL will always be used as an absolute tolerance.

 -- Function File:  demo ('NAME',N)
     Runs any examples associated with the function 'NAME'.  Examples are stored in the script file, or in a file with the same name but no extension somewhere on your path.  To keep them separate from the usual script code, all lines are prefixed by `%!'.  Each example is introduced by the keyword 'demo' flush left to the prefix, with no intervening spaces.  The remainder of the example can contain arbitrary Octave code.  For example:

             %!demo
             %! t=0:0.01:2*pi; x = sin(t);
             %! plot(t,x)
             %! %-------------------------------------------------
             %! % the figure window shows one cycle of a sine wave

     Note that the code is displayed before it is executed, so a simple comment at the end suffices.  It is generally not necessary to use disp or printf within the demo.

     Demos are run in a function environment with no access to external variables.  This means that all demos in your function must use separate initialization code.  Alternatively, you can combine your demos into one huge demo, with the code:

             %! input("Press <enter> to continue: ","s");

     between the sections, but this is discouraged.  Other techniques include using multiple plots by saying figure between each, or using subplot to put multiple plots in the same window.

     Also, since demo evaluates inside a function context, you cannot define new functions inside a demo.  Instead you will have to use `eval(example('function',n))' to see them.  Because eval only evaluates one line, or one statement if the statement crosses multiple lines, you must wrap your demo in "if 1 <demo stuff> endif" with the 'if' on the same line as 'demo'.  For example,

            %!demo if 1
            %!  function y=f(x)
            %!    y=x;
            %!  endfunction
            %!  f(3)
            %! endif

     Return true if CODE fails with an error message matching PATTERN, otherwise produce an error.  Note that CODE is a string and if CODE runs successfully, the error produced is:

                    expected error but got none

     If the code fails with a different error, the message produced is:

 -- Function File:  speed (F, INIT, MAX_N, F2, TOL)
 -- Function File: [ORDER, N, T_F, T_F2] = speed (...)
     Determine the execution time of an expression for various N.  The N are log-spaced from 1 to MAX_N.  For each N, an initialization expression is computed to create whatever data are needed for the test.  If a second expression is given, the execution times of the two expressions will be compared.  Called without output arguments the results are presented graphically.

    `F'
          The expression to evaluate.

    `MAX_N'
          The maximum test length to run.  Default value is 100.  Alternatively, use `[min_n,max_n]' or for complete control, `[n1,n2,...,nk]'.

    `INIT'
          Initialization expression for function argument values.  Use K for the test number and N for the size of the test.  This should compute values for all variables listed in args.  Note that init will be evaluated first for k = 0, so things which are constant throughout the test can be computed then.  The default value is `X = randn (N, 1);'.

    `F2'
          An alternative expression to evaluate, so the speed of the two can be compared.  Default is `[]'.

    `TOL'
          If TOL is `Inf', then no comparison will be made between the results of expression F and expression F2.  Otherwise, expression F should produce a value V and expression F2 should produce a value V2, and these shall be compared using `assert(V,V2,TOL)'.  If TOL is positive, the tolerance is assumed to be absolute.  If TOL is negative, the tolerance is assumed to be relative.  The default is `eps'.

    `ORDER'
          The time complexity of the expression `O(a n^p)'.  This is a structure with fields `a' and `p'.

    `N'
          The values N for which the expression was calculated and the execution time was greater than zero.

    `T_F'
          The nonzero execution times recorded for the expression F in seconds.

    `T_F2'
          The nonzero execution times recorded for the expression F2 in seconds.  If it is needed, the mean time ratio is just `mean(T_f./T_f2)'.


     The slope of the execution time graph shows the approximate power of the asymptotic running time `O(n^p)'.  This power is plotted for the region over which it is approximated (the latter half of the graph).  The estimated power is not very accurate, but should be sufficient to determine the general order of your algorithm.  It should indicate if for example your implementation is unexpectedly `O(n^2)' rather than `O(n)' because it extends a vector each time through the loop rather than preallocating one which is big enough.  For example, in the current version of Octave, the following is not the expected `O(n)':

          speed ("for i = 1:n, y{i} = x(i); end", "", [1000,10000])

     but it is if you preallocate the cell array `y':

          speed ("for i = 1:n, y{i} = x(i); end", ...
                 "x = rand (n, 1); y = cell (size (x));", [1000, 10000])

     An attempt is made to approximate the cost of the individual operations, but it is wildly inaccurate.  You can improve the stability somewhat by doing more work for each `n'.  For example:

          speed ("airy(x)", "x = rand (n, 10)", [10000, 100000])

     When comparing a new and original expression, the line on the speedup ratio graph should be larger than 1 if the new expression is faster.  Better algorithms have a shallow slope.  Generally, vectorizing an algorithm will not change the slope of the execution time graph, but it will shift it relative to the original.  For example:

          speed ("v = sum (x)", "", [10000, 100000], ...
                 "v = 0; for i = 1:length (x), v += x(i); end")

     A more complex example, if you had an original version of `xcorr' using for loops and another version using an FFT, you could compare the run speed for various lags as follows, or for a fixed lag with varying vector lengths as follows:

          speed ("v = xcorr (x, n)", "x = rand (128, 1);", 100,
                 "v2 = xcorr_orig (x, n)", -100*eps)
          speed ("v = xcorr (x, 15)", "x = rand (20+n, 1);", 100,
                 "v2 = xcorr_orig (x, n)", -100*eps)

     Assuming one of the two versions is in XCORR_ORIG, this would compare their speed and their output values.  Note that the FFT version is not exact, so we specify an acceptable tolerance on the comparison `100*eps', and the errors should be computed relatively, as `abs((X - Y)./Y)' rather than absolutely as `abs(X - Y)'.

     Type `example('speed')' to see some real examples.  Note for obscure reasons, you can't run examples 1 and 2 directly using `demo('speed')'.  Instead use, `eval(example('speed',1))' and `eval(example('speed',2))'.

 -- Function File: [CODE, IDX] = test ('NAME','grabdemo')
     Perform tests from the first file in the loadpath matching NAME.  `test' can be called as a command or as a function.  Called with a single argument NAME, the tests are run interactively and stop after the first error is encountered.

     With a second argument the tests which are performed and the amount of output is selected.

    'quiet'
          Don't report all the tests as they happen, just the errors.

    'normal'
          Report all tests as they happen, but don't do tests which require user interaction.

    'verbose'
          Do tests which require user interaction.

     The argument FID can be used to allow batch processing.  Errors can be written to the already open file defined by FID, and hopefully when Octave crashes this file will tell you what was happening when it did.  You can use `stdout' if you want to see the results as they happen.  You can also give a file name rather than an FID, in which case the contents of the file will be replaced with the log from the current test.

     Called with a single output argument SUCCESS, `test' returns true if all of the tests were successful.  Called with two output arguments N and MAX, the number of successful tests and the total number of tests in the file NAME are returned.

     If the second argument is the string 'grabdemo', the contents of the demo blocks are extracted but not executed.  Code for all code blocks is concatenated and returned as CODE with IDX being a vector of positions of the ends of the demo blocks.

     If the second argument is 'explain', then NAME is ignored and an explanation of the line markers used is written to the file FID.  See also: error, assert, fail, demo, example.

     Notes:

        * Years can be negative and/or fractional.

        * Months below 1 are considered to be January.

        * Days of the month start at 1.

        * Days beyond the end of the month go into subsequent months.

        * Days before the beginning of the month go to the previous month.

        * Days can be fractional.

     *Warning:* this function does not attempt to handle Julian calendars so dates before Octave 15, 1582 are wrong by as much as eleven days.  Also be aware that only Roman Catholic countries adopted the calendar in 1582.  It took until 1924 for it to be adopted everywhere.  See the Wikipedia entry on the Gregorian calendar for more details.

     *Warning:* leap seconds are ignored.  A table of leap seconds is available on the Wikipedia entry for leap seconds.  See also: date, clock, now, datestr, datevec, calendar, weekday.
