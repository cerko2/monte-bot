## Compute the probability density function (PDF) at @var{x} of the
## hypergeometric distribution with parameters @var{t}, @var{m}, and
## @var{n}.  This is the probability of obtaining @var{x} marked items
## when randomly drawing a sample of size @var{n} without replacement
## from a population of total size @var{t} containing @var{m} marked items.
##
## The arguments must be of common size or scalar.
