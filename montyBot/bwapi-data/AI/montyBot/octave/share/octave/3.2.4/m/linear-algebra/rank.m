## @deftypefn {Function File} {} rank (@var{a}, @var{tol})
## Compute the rank of @var{a}, using the singular value decomposition.
## The rank is taken to be the number of singular values of @var{a} that
## are greater than the specified tolerance @var{tol}.  If the second
## argument is omitted, it is taken to be
##
## @example
## tol = max (size (@var{a})) * sigma(1) * eps;
## @end example
##
## @noindent
## where @code{eps} is machine precision and @code{sigma(1)} is the largest
## singular value of @var{a}.
## @end deftypefn
