.SH NAME

.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH OPTIONS
The complete set of command-line options for octave is available by
running the command
.nf

    octave \-\-help

.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Octave is a high-level language, primarily intended for numerical
computations.  It provides a convenient command line interface for
solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically.
.SH DOCUMENTATION
The primary documentation for Octave is written using Texinfo, the GNU
documentation system, which allows the same source files to be used to
produce on-line and printed versions of the manual.
.PP
You can read the on-line copy of the Octave documentation by issuing
the command
.nf

    octave:13> help \-i

.fi
while running Octave interactively, by using the GNU Emacs info mode,
or by running standalone programs like info or xinfo.
.SH BUGS
The best way to submit a bug report for Octave is to use the command
.nf

     octave:13> bug_report

.fi
while running Octave interactively.  This will create a template bug
report file and start an editor on that file.  Your 
message will be sent to the bug-octave mailing list
once you are finished editing the template.
.PP
If you are unable to use the bug_report command, send your message
to the
.B bug@octave.org
mailing list by some other means.  Please read the `Bugs' chapter in
the Octave manual to find out how to submit a bug report that will
enable the Octave maintainers to fix the problem.
