## Get or set the limits of the y-axis of the current plot.  Called without
## arguments @code{ylim} returns the y-axis limits of the current plot.
## If passed a two element vector @var{xl}, the limits of the y-axis are set
## to this value.
##
## The current mode for calculation of the y-axis can be returned with a
## call @code{ylim ('mode')}, and can be either 'auto' or 'manual'.  The 
## current plotting mode can be set by passing either 'auto' or 'manual' 
## as the argument.
##
## If passed an handle as the first argument, then operate on this handle
## rather than the current axes handle.
