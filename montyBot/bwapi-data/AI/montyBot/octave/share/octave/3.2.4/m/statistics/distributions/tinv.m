## @deftypefn {Function File} {} tinv (@var{x}, @var{n})
## For each probability value @var{x}, compute the inverse of the
## cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the t (Student)
## distribution with degrees of freedom @var{n}.  This function is
## analogous to looking in a table for the t-value of a single-tailed
## distribution.
## @end deftypefn

## For very large n, the "correct" formula does not really work well,
## and the quantiles of the standard normal distribution are used
## directly.
