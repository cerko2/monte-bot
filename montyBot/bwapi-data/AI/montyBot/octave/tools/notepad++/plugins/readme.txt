Falling Bricks plugin version 1.1
=================================

Summary
-------
This plugin for Notepad++ is a simple tetris-like game that you can play from within Notepad++.

Rules
-----
The rules are exactly the same, so I hope no explanation is needed :-P

Notes
-----
1. This is the most bare-basic implementation of tetris, so don't expect any fancy 3D graphics or surround sound effects.
2. If you close the dialog box of this plugin (maybe your boss just appeared?), the game will auto pause, and you can resume from where you last left it.
3. Your high scores are not remembered, So please scribble it into Notepad++ yourself!


Have fun :-)
