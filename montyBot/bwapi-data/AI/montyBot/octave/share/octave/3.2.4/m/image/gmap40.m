## @deftypefn {Function File} {} gmap40 (@var{n})
## Create a color colormap.  The colormap is red, green, blue, yellow,
## magenta and cyan.  These are the colors that are allowed with patch
## objects using gnuplot 4.0, and so this colormap function is specially
## designed for users of gnuplot 4.0.  The argument @var{n} should be 
## a scalar.  If it is omitted, a length of 6 is assumed.  Larger values
## of @var{n} result in a repetition of the above colors
## @seealso{colormap}
