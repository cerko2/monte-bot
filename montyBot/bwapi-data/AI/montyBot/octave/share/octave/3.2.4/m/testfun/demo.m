## @deftypefn {Function File} {} demo ('@var{name}',@var{n})
##
## Runs any examples associated with the function '@var{name}'.  
## Examples are stored in the script file, or in a file with the same 
## name but no extension somewhere on your path.  To keep them separate 
## from the usual script code, all lines are prefixed by @code{%!}.  Each
## example is introduced by the keyword 'demo' flush left to the prefix,
## with no intervening spaces.  The remainder of the example can contain 
## arbitrary Octave code.  For example:
##
## @example
## @group
##    %!demo
##    %! t=0:0.01:2*pi; x = sin(t);
##    %! plot(t,x)
##    %! %-------------------------------------------------
##    %! % the figure window shows one cycle of a sine wave
## @end group
## @end example
##
## Note that the code is displayed before it is executed, so a simple
## comment at the end suffices.  It is generally not necessary to use
## disp or printf within the demo.
##
## Demos are run in a function environment with no access to external
## variables.  This means that all demos in your function must use
## separate initialization code.  Alternatively, you can combine your
## demos into one huge demo, with the code:
##
## @example
##    %! input("Press <enter> to continue: ","s");
## @end example
##
## between the sections, but this is discouraged.  Other techniques
## include using multiple plots by saying figure between each, or
## using subplot to put multiple plots in the same window.
##
## Also, since demo evaluates inside a function context, you cannot
## define new functions inside a demo.  Instead you will have to
## use @code{eval(example('function',n))} to see them.  Because eval only
## evaluates one line, or one statement if the statement crosses
## multiple lines, you must wrap your demo in "if 1 <demo stuff> endif"
## with the 'if' on the same line as 'demo'.  For example,
##
## @example
## @group
##   %!demo if 1
##   %!  function y=f(x)
##   %!    y=x;
##   %!  endfunction
##   %!  f(3)
##   %! endif
## @end group
## @end example
## @seealso{test, example}
## @end deftypefn

## FIXME: modify subplot so that gnuplot_has_multiplot == 0 causes it to
## use the current figure window but pause if not plotting in the
## first subplot.
