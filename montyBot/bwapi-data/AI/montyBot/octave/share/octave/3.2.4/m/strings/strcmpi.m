## @deftypefn {Function File} {} strcmpi (@var{s1}, @var{s2})
## Ignoring case, return 1 if the character strings (or character
## arrays) @var{s1} and @var{s2} are the same, and 0 otherwise.
##
## If either @var{s1} or @var{s2} is a cell array of strings, then an array
## of the same size is returned, containing the values described above for
## every member of the cell array.  The other argument may also be a cell
## array of strings (of the same size or with only one element), char matrix
## or character string.
##
## @strong{Caution:} For compatibility with @sc{matlab}, Octave's strcmpi
## function returns 1 if the character strings are equal, and 0 otherwise.
## This is just the opposite of the corresponding C library function.
