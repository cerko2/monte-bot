<h2 class="appendix">Appendix F Installing Octave</h2>

   <p><a name="index-installing-Octave-2556"></a>
Here is the procedure for installing Octave from scratch on a Unix
system.

     <ul>
<li>Run the shell script <span class="file">configure</span>.  This will determine the features
your system has (or doesn't have) and create a file named
<span class="file">Makefile</span> from each of the files named <span class="file">Makefile.in</span>.

     <p>Here is a summary of the configure options that are most frequently used
when building Octave:

          <dl>
<dt><code>--prefix=</code><var>prefix</var><dd>Install Octave in subdirectories below <var>prefix</var>.  The default value
of <var>prefix</var> is <span class="file">/usr/local</span>.

          <br><dt><code>--srcdir=</code><var>dir</var><dd>Look for Octave sources in the directory <var>dir</var>.

          <br><dt><code>--enable-bounds-check</code><dd>Enable bounds checking for indexing operators in the internal array
classes.  This option is primarily used for debugging Octave.  Building
Octave with this option has a negative impact on performance and is not
recommended for general use.

          <br><dt><code>--enable-64</code><dd>This is an <strong>experimental</strong> option to enable Octave to use 64-bit
integers for array dimensions and indexing on 64-bit platforms.  You
probably don't want to use this option unless you know what you are
doing.

          <p>If you use <code>--enable-64</code>, you must ensure that your Fortran
compiler generates code with 8 byte signed <code>INTEGER</code> values, and
that your <span class="sc">blas</span> and <span class="sc">lapack</span> libraries are compiled to use 8 byte
signed integers for array dimensions and indexing.

          <br><dt><code>--enable-shared</code><dd>Create shared libraries (this is the default).  If you are planning to
use the dynamic loading features, you will probably want to use this
option.  It will make your <span class="file">.oct</span> files much smaller and on some
systems it may be necessary to build shared libraries in order to use
dynamically linked functions.

          <p>You may also want to build a shared version of <code>libstdc++</code>, if your
system doesn't already have one.

          <br><dt><code>--enable-dl</code><dd>Use <code>dlopen</code> and friends to make Octave capable of dynamically
linking externally compiled functions (this is the default if
<code>--enable-shared</code> is specified).  This option only works on systems
that actually have these functions.  If you plan on using this feature, you
should probably also use <code>--enable-shared</code> to reduce the size of
your <span class="file">.oct</span> files.

          <br><dt><code>--without-blas</code><dd>Compile and use the generic <span class="sc">blas</span> and <span class="sc">lapack</span> versions included with
Octave.  By default, configure first looks for <span class="sc">blas</span> and <span class="sc">lapack</span> matrix
libraries on your system, including optimized <span class="sc">blas</span> implementations such
as the free ATLAS 3.0, as well as vendor-tuned libraries.  (The use of
an optimized <span class="sc">blas</span> will generally result in several-times faster matrix
operations.)  Only use this option if your system has <span class="sc">blas</span>/<span class="sc">lapack</span>
libraries that cause problems for some reason.  You can also use
<code>--with-blas=lib</code> to specify a particular <span class="sc">blas</span> library
 that configure doesn't check for automatically.

          <br><dt><code>--without-ccolamd</code><dd>Don't use CCOLAMD, disable some sparse matrix functionality.

          <br><dt><code>--without-colamd</code><dd>Don't use COLAMD, disable some sparse matrix functionality.

          <br><dt><code>--without-curl</code><dd>Don't use the cURL, disable the <code>urlread</code> and <code>urlwrite</code>
functions.

          <br><dt><code>--without-cxsparse</code><dd>Don't use CXSPARSE, disable some sparse matrix functionality.

          <br><dt><code>--without-umfpack</code><dd>Don't use UMFPACK, disable some sparse matrix functionality.

          <br><dt><code>--without-fftw</code><dd>Use the included <span class="sc">fftpack</span> library instead of the <span class="sc">fftw</span> library.

          <br><dt><code>--without-glpk</code><dd>Don't use the GLPK library for linear programming.

          <br><dt><code>--without-hdf5</code><dd>Don't use the HDF5 library for reading and writing HDF5 files.

          <br><dt><code>--without-zlib</code><dd>Don't use the zlib library, disable data file compression and support
for recent MAT file formats.

          <br><dt><code>--without-lapack</code><dd>Compile and use the generic <span class="sc">blas</span> and <span class="sc">lapack</span> versions included with
Octave.  By default, configure first looks for <span class="sc">blas</span> and <span class="sc">lapack</span> matrix
libraries on your system, including optimized <span class="sc">blas</span> implementations such
as the free ATLAS 3.0, as well as vendor-tuned libraries.  (The use of
an optimized <span class="sc">blas</span> will generally result in several-times faster matrix
operations.)  Only use this option if your system has <span class="sc">blas</span>/<span class="sc">lapack</span>
libraries that cause problems for some reason.  You can also use
<code>--with-blas=lib</code> to specify a particular <span class="sc">blas</span> library
 that configure doesn't check for automatically.

          <br><dt><code>--without-framework-carbon</code><dd>Don't use framework Carbon headers, libraries and specific source code
for compilation even if the configure test succeeds (the default value
is <code>--with-framework-carbon</code>).  This is a platform specific configure
option for Mac systems.

          <br><dt><code>--without-framework-opengl</code><dd>Don't use framework OpenGL headers, libraries and specific source code
for compilation even if the configure test succeeds.  If this option is
given then OpenGL headers and libraries in standard system locations are
tested (the default value is <code>--with-framework-opengl</code>).  This is a
platform specific configure option for Mac systems.

          <br><dt><code>--help</code><dd>Print a summary of the options recognized by the configure script. 
</dl>

     <p>See the file <span class="file">INSTALL</span> for more general information about the
command line options used by configure.  That file also contains
instructions for compiling in a directory other than where the source
is located.

     <li>Run make.

     <p>You will need a recent version of GNU Make.  Modifying Octave's
makefiles to work with other make programs is probably not worth
your time.  We recommend you get and compile GNU Make instead.

     <p>For plotting, you will need to have gnuplot installed on your system. 
Gnuplot is a command-driven interactive function plotting program. 
Gnuplot is copyrighted, but freely distributable.  The `gnu' in gnuplot
is a coincidence&mdash;it is not related to the GNU project or the FSF in
any but the most peripheral sense.

     <p>To compile Octave, you will need a recent version of GNU Make.  You will
also need a recent version of <code>g++</code> or other ANSI C++ compiler.  You
will also need a Fortran 77 compiler or <code>f2c</code>.  If you use
<code>f2c</code>, you will need a script like <code>fort77</code> that works like a
normal Fortran compiler by combining <code>f2c</code> with your C compiler in
a single script.

     <p>If you plan to modify the parser you will also need GNU <code>bison</code> and
<code>flex</code>.  If you modify the documentation, you will need GNU
Texinfo, along with the patch for the <code>makeinfo</code> program that is
distributed with Octave.

     <p>GNU Make, <code>gcc</code>, and <code>libstdc++</code>, <code>gnuplot</code>,
<code>bison</code>, <code>flex</code>, and Texinfo are all available from many
anonymous ftp archives.  The primary site is <a href="ftp.gnu.org">ftp.gnu.org</a>, but it
is often very busy.  A list of sites that mirror the software on
<a href="ftp.gnu.org">ftp.gnu.org</a> is available by anonymous ftp from
<a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/GNUinfo/FTP">ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/GNUinfo/FTP</a>.

     <p>You will need about 1 gigabyte of disk storage to work with when
building Octave from source (considerably less if you don't compile with
debugging symbols).  To do that, use the command

     <pre class="example">          make CFLAGS=-O CXXFLAGS=-O LDFLAGS=
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">instead of just <span class="samp">make</span>.

     <li>If you encounter errors while compiling Octave, first check the list of
known problems below to see if there is a workaround or solution for
your problem.  If not,
see <a href="Trouble.html#Trouble">Trouble</a>,
for information about how to report bugs.

     <li>Once you have successfully compiled Octave, run <span class="samp">make install</span>.

     <p>This will install a copy of Octave, its libraries, and its documentation
in the destination directory.  As distributed, Octave is installed in
the following directories.  In the table below, <var>prefix</var> defaults to
<span class="file">/usr/local</span>, <var>version</var> stands for the current version number
of the interpreter, and <var>arch</var> is the type of computer on which
Octave is installed (for example, <span class="samp">i586-unknown-gnu</span>).

          <dl>
<dt><var>prefix</var><span class="file">/bin</span><dd>Octave and other binaries that people will want to run directly.

          <br><dt><var>prefix</var><span class="file">/lib</span><dd>Libraries like libcruft.a and liboctave.a.

          <br><dt><var>prefix</var><span class="file">/share</span><dd>Architecture-independent data files.

          <br><dt><var>prefix</var><span class="file">/include/octave</span><dd>Include files distributed with Octave.

          <br><dt><var>prefix</var><span class="file">/man/man1</span><dd>Unix-style man pages describing Octave.

same time.

          <br><dt><var>prefix</var><span class="file">/lib/octave/</span><var>version</var><span class="file">/exec/</span><var>arch</var><dd>Executables to be run by Octave rather than the user.

          <br><dt><var>prefix</var><span class="file">/lib/octave/</span><var>version</var><span class="file">/oct/</span><var>arch</var><dd>Object files that will be dynamically loaded.
