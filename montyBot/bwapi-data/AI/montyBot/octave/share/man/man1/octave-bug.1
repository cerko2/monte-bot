.SH NAME
octave-bug \- report a bug in GNU Octave
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B octave-bug
.RB [\| \-s
.IR subject \|]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B octave-bug
is a shell script to help the user compose and mail bug reports
concerning Octave in a standard format.  
.B octave-bug
is typically invoked by the Octave command
.B bug_report
which is intended to be called interactively from within Octave. This
provides the best way to submit a bug report for Octave. It creates a
template bug report file and starts an editor on that file.  The bug report
will be sent to the bug-octave mailing list once the editing has been
completed (this assumes of course that your system can use email). However,
the user could also call \fBoctave-bug\fR outside of Octave.
.PP
Please read the `Bugs' chapter in the Octave manual to find out how to submit
a bug report that will enable the Octave maintainers to fix the problem.  If
you are unable to use the bug_report command, send your message to the
bug-octave mailing list, bug@octave.org.
