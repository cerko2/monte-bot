Known Issues with octave/mingw32 3.2.4:
--------------------------------------

*) The command "clear all" results in a segfault.
   This is currently triggered by the following octave-forge packages:
      windows
      octcdf
      communications
      ga (depends on communications)
      
   The error occurs only if any of these packages is marked "-auto" 
   i.e. is loaded at startup.
   
*) Installing octave respectively running octave from a path which contains
   spaces breaks the installation of octave-forge packages using octave's
   package manager pkg.m.
   It this therefore highly recommended to install octave to a path WITHOUT
   spaces. Octave will work if installed to a path including spaces, and all 
   packages added at the installation will work if installed into a path 
   containing spaces, HOWEVER you will currently NOT be able to install 
   packages using octave's package manager at a later time if Octave was 
   installed to a directory containing spaces.

*) "make check" results:
