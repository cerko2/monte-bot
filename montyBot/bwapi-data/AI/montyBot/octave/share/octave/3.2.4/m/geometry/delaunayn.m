## Form the Delaunay triangulation for a set of points.
## The Delaunay triangulation is a tessellation of the convex hull of the
## points such that no n-sphere defined by the n-triangles contains
## any other points from the set.
## The input matrix @var{P} of size @code{[n, dim]} contains @var{n}
## points in a space of dimension dim.  The return matrix @var{T} has the
## size @code{[m, dim+1]}.  It contains for each row a set of indices to
## the points, which describes a simplex of dimension dim.  For example,
## a 2d simplex is a triangle and 3d simplex is a tetrahedron.
## 
## Extra options for the underlying Qhull command can be specified by the
## second argument.  This argument is a cell array of strings.  The default
## options depend on the dimension of the input: 
## 
## @itemize 
## @item 2D and 3D: @var{opt} = @code{@{"Qt", "Qbb", "Qc"@}}
## @item 4D and higher: @var{opt} = @code{@{"Qt", "Qbb", "Qc", "Qz"@}} 
## @end itemize
## 
## If @var{opt} is [], then the default arguments are used.  If @var{opt}
## is @code{@{"@w{}"@}}, then none of the default arguments are used by Qhull. 
## See the Qhull documentation for the available options. 
## 
## All options can also be specified as single string, for example
## @code{"Qt Qbb Qc Qz"}.

  ## Try to remove the zero volume simplices. The volume of the i-th simplex is

  ## (reference http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex). Any simplex with a 
  ## relative volume less than some arbitrary criteria is rejected. The 
  ## criteria we use is the volume of the simplex corresponding to an 
  ## orthogonal simplex is equal edge length all equal to the edge length of 
  ## the original simplex. If the relative volume is 1e3*eps then the simplex
  ## is rejected. Note division of the two volumes means that the factor 
  ## prod(1:n) is dropped.
