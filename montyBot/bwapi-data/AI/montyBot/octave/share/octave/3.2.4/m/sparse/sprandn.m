## @deftypefnx {Function File} {} sprandn (@var{s})
## Generate a random sparse matrix.  The size of the matrix will be
## @var{m} by @var{n}, with a density of values given by @var{d}.
## @var{d} should be between 0 and 1. Values will be normally
## distributed with mean of zero and variance 1.
##
## Note: sometimes the actual density may be a bit smaller than @var{d}. 
## This is unlikely to happen for large really sparse matrices.
##
## If called with a single matrix argument, a random sparse matrix is
## generated wherever the matrix @var{S} is non-zero.
