## @deftypefn {Function File} {} asctime (@var{tm_struct})
## Convert a time structure to a string using the following five-field
## format: Thu Mar 28 08:40:14 1996.  For example,
##
## @example
## @group
## asctime (localtime (time ()))
##      @result{} "Mon Feb 17 01:15:06 1997\n"
## @end group
## @end example
##
## This is equivalent to @code{ctime (time ())}.
